// hard-coded production URL as a *default* that could silently run destructive
// sign-ups against prod: the base URLs default to the local dev ports, and a CI
// run MUST set them explicitly to the preview it provisioned.
//
// Capability flags model the honest reality of the deployment under test:
//   - MAIL: does the deployment actually send email (RESEND_API_KEY set)? If
//     not, verification/reset flows are STRUCTURALLY unavailable and their specs
//     skip cleanly (email verification is currently OFF — auth config derives it
//     from RESEND_API_KEY's absence).
//   - GOOGLE: can we drive Google OAuth? Never in CI — see personas/registry.ts.
//   - GOD: do we have credentials for an account that is on the deployment's
//     GOD_EMAILS list, so org-console (god) journeys can run?
