// specs/supplier/claim-by-email.spec.ts — the email-overlap claim (M3-28,
// docs/technical-spec/12-suppliers.md; apps/suppliers/lib/session.ts resolveSupplierForUser).
//
// THE RULE: when a supplier signs in with a VERIFIED email that matches an
// accountless catalog row's free-text contact, the portal ATTACHES that user to
// the existing row (no duplicate). A fresh, non-overlapping email instead makes a
// brand-new row. The claim only fires for a *verified* email — an unverified
// address can never hijack an imported supplier — so this journey is inherently
// mail-dependent AND, because the accountless target row must be created by the
// org (the seed's real business contacts must never be hard-coded into a test —
// AGENTS.md), god-dependent. Hence: skipUnlessMail() + skipUnlessGod().
//
// The shared `registerSupplier` factory only provisions a readable mailbox when
// NO explicit email is passed, so the verified-claim path is hand-driven here
// (sign up with our mailbox, click the real verification link). This is the
// honest way to exercise a flow the factory does not cover; it drives the same
// real UI, no DB back door.
//
// NOTE (see report): this is the least-verifiable spec in the suite — it exercises
// the mail-ON branch, which is off by default, so it is written correct-by-
// construction from source and has never executed.
