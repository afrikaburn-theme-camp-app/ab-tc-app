// specs/supplier/documents.spec.ts — supplier document acknowledgement drives a
// bound onboarding step (M3-28, docs/technical-spec/12-suppliers.md
// §"Supplier documents"). The org publishes a required document BOUND to the
// self-service "Supplier agreement signed" step; acknowledging it completes that
// step, and withdrawing the acknowledgement reverts it — a green step whose
// evidence was withdrawn would be a lie.
//
// Needs a pre-provisioned god account to publish the document (org-only surface),
// so this whole spec skipUnlessGod. Documents are edition-global (shared by every
// supplier of the active edition), so the published document is given a unique
// title and left in place — acceptable on the throwaway E2E Neon branch that CI
// deletes on completion (README "Cleanup / isolation"); it never reverts another
// supplier's button-completed step because reconciliation only runs on an ack.
