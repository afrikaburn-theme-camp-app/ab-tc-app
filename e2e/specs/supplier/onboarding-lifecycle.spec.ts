// specs/supplier/onboarding-lifecycle.spec.ts — the seven-step Supplier Depot
// checklist, driven end to end (M3-28, docs/technical-spec/12-suppliers.md §Onboarding).
//
// The rule that matters (packages/core supplier-onboarding.ts):
//   - self-service steps (agreement) flip pending↔completed instantly;
//   - org-reviewed steps (inventory, crew) the supplier can SUBMIT (→ awaiting)
//     and WITHDRAW, but never mark complete;
//   - org-confirmed steps (deposit, briefing, fee) the supplier cannot touch at
//     all — they show "awaiting AfrikaBurn" and offer NO control.
//
// The org-confirmed boundary is asserted two ways below: the copy says it, AND
// the card exposes zero buttons (the affordance is absent, not merely hidden).
// See the report for why the deepest server-refusal of a forged org-confirmed
// transition is proven by @quagga/core unit tests rather than here.
