//
// Persona: CAMP MEMBER. A camp lead can send a BLOCKING questionnaire; for the
// member that is a hard gate — the app is unusable until it's answered, and the
// ONLY reachable actions are filling it in and signing out (docs/technical-spec/10-questionnaire-engine.md
// §"Engine mechanics"; roadmap M3-27's blocking clause, member side).
//
// This spec proves the gate both TRAPS (every other surface redirects back to
// it, server-side) and RELEASES (after submit the app opens). A gate that traps
// but never releases, or releases without an answer, is the failure this guards.
