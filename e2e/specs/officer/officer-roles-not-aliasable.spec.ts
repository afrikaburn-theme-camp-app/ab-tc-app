// Officer roles are NOT aliasable (M3-26; docs/technical-spec/05-camp-roles-and-officers.md §"Officers cannot be
// aliased"; docs/technical-spec/01-auth-and-identity.md invariant 8). Org-facing officer vocabulary
// stays uniform across every camp, so a camp cannot rename, recolour, or delete
// an officer role — unlike its own custom roles.
//
// HONEST SCOPE NOTE: the SERVER guards (renameRole / setRoleAppearance /
// removeRole rejecting kind==='officer', via canRenameRoleKind /
// canDeleteRoleKind) are proven by @quagga/core + roles-store unit tests. They
// are deliberately UNREACHABLE from the UI — the officer row exposes NO rename,
// recolour, or delete control to POST — so there is no client path for an E2E to
// invoke and be refused. What an E2E CAN prove, and does here, is that the camp
// is given no aliasing affordance for officers while it IS given one for custom
// roles (so the absence is by design, not a missing feature), and that officer
// rows render the FIXED catalog names. The pure server-refusal lives in the unit
// suite by construction; this spec guards the surface that would expose it.
