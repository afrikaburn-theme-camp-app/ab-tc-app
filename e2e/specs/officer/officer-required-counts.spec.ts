// Outstanding required-officer counts reflect reality (M3-26; docs/technical-spec/05-camp-roles-and-officers.md
// §"Outstanding-officers indicator" + §"Free camps: officers are entirely
// optional"). The badge is a live count of unassigned REQUIRED officers, and it
// exists ONLY for a camp with a registration in flight — a free camp shows no
// requirement at all. Assigning a required officer must decrement the count.
//
// Single-account journey: the lead is themselves a member, so they can self-
// assign to prove the count moves — no second burner needed.
