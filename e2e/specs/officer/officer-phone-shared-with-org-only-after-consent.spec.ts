// Officer journey — the POPIA phone-sharing boundary (M3-26, the crux).
//
// This is the ONLY path in the whole product that shares a burner's phone with
// AfrikaBurn (docs/compliance-and-incident-response.md §"Lawful basis"; docs/technical-spec/05-camp-roles-and-officers.md §"Officers are
// ALSO registrations"). So the assertion is precise and two-sided IN ONE TEST:
//   BEFORE acceptance — a PENDING officer's phone is NOWHERE on the org review
//                       (the server query filters consent='accepted' AND
//                        org_visible=true, so it never reaches the client), and
//   AFTER  acceptance — the same phone (and the officer's name) IS on the review.
//
// Adversarial value (M3-30): delete the `consent = accepted` / `org_visible`
// filter in getRegistrationOfficers and the BEFORE assertion goes red — a
// pending officer's phone would surface. That is exactly the leak this guards.
//
// Needs the org console → god. Skips cleanly when god isn't provisioned; it is
// never faked (a fresh sign-up can't self-elevate — personas/registry.ts).
