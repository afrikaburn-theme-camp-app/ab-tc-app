# @quagga/e2e — Playwright end-to-end harness

The shared harness for the three Quagga Portal apps: **176 tests across 70 spec files
and 8 personas** (`anon`, `new-burner`, `camp-member`, `camp-lead`, `officer`,
`org-staff`, `god`, `supplier`). **Every persona agent depends on this API.** Import
from here; do not re-implement sign-up/onboarding/etc. Tests drive the **real UI**
against a running deployment (local / preview / prod) — no database back doors for
setup.

**This suite has been run, and it finds things the unit gate cannot.** `turbo run
lint typecheck test build` lints and typechecks this package but **executes no
Playwright**, so nothing here proves anything until it is run deliberately. The
sign-up dead-end — a live session sitting behind a "check your inbox" message that no
deployment without a mail provider could ever satisfy — passed lint, typecheck, unit
tests and build, and died on first contact with a browser.

## Running

The normal way, from a cold machine — brings up Postgres and the two Neon proxies,
migrates, seeds, boots all three apps, then runs the suite:

```bash
pnpm e2e:local                      # whole suite (desktop-chromium, 2 workers)
pnpm e2e:local specs/new-burner     # one persona
E2E_RESET_DB=1 pnpm e2e:local       # wipe the local DB first
E2E_WORKERS=4 pnpm e2e:local        # if the machine can take it
```

Against an already-running deployment (a preview, or dev servers you started
yourself):

```bash
pnpm --filter @quagga/e2e install:browsers   # once, installs chromium
cp e2e/.env.example e2e/.env                  # point at your deployment (see below)
pnpm --filter @quagga/e2e e2e                 # full suite, both projects
pnpm --filter @quagga/e2e e2e:smoke           # @smoke subset (PR gate)
pnpm --filter @quagga/e2e e2e:ui              # interactive
pnpm --filter @quagga/e2e e2e:report          # open last HTML report
```

`pnpm e2e:local` runs **both projects** (`desktop-chromium` and `mobile-360`) —
narrow it with `E2E_PROJECTS=desktop-chromium`. CI runs `desktop-chromium` only;
`mobile-360` has never been triaged, so it is expected red.

Two things `e2e:local` does on purpose, both of which look wrong until you know why:
it **kills and restarts `next dev`** (a long-lived dev server keeps a stale module
graph after a file is deleted and serves 500s while `turbo build` stays green — that
once produced 104 phantom failures that read exactly like product bugs), and it
**raises the auth rate-limit ceiling** (every Playwright worker drives real sign-ups
from 127.0.0.1, so the limiter correctly sees one client hammering `/sign-up/email`
and starts returning 429, which looks exactly like broken auth). **Never set
`AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_*` on a real deployment.**

**Local Postgres is not Neon.** The proxies are faithful enough to catch logic, not
pooling behaviour or cold starts. Green locally is strong evidence, never proof.

Config is 100% env-driven (`e2e/lib/env.ts`). Base URLs default to local dev ports
(web 3000 / org 3001 / suppliers 3002); CI overrides all three with the preview.
The suite **refuses to run against a production apex host** unless
`E2E_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=true` — it creates real accounts and rows.

## Projects (viewports)

- `desktop-chromium` — 1280×800
- `mobile-360` — 360×780 (the design's mobile baseline)

Retries: 1 in CI, 0 in the nightly mobile workflow. Trace/video/screenshot: retained on failure only.

## Writing a spec

```ts
import { test, expect, skipUnlessMail, skipUnlessGod } from "../fixtures";
import {
  signUpBurner,
  createCamp,
  submitRegistration,
} from "../personas/factories";

test("a camp registers", async ({ webPage }) => {
  const lead = await signUpBurner(webPage, { onboard: true });
  const camp = await createCamp(webPage);
  await submitRegistration(webPage, camp.slug);
});
```

### Fixtures (`e2e/fixtures.ts`)

| Fixture            | Type                     | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `webPage`          | `Page`                   | Isolated context against the **web** app.             |
| `orgPage`          | `Page`                   | Isolated context against the **org** app.             |
| `suppliersPage`    | `Page`                   | Isolated context against the **suppliers** app.       |
| `makeAppPage(app)` | `(app) => Promise<Page>` | Make an extra isolated page for any app; auto-closed. |

Each app gets its **own** context/page because cross-subdomain SSO does **not**
span the different hosts of a preview — sign in on the app you are testing. All
pages inherit the running project's viewport and carry the Vercel protection
bypass header. **No shared mutable state** — every spec creates its own data.

Helpers: `skipUnlessMail()`, `skipUnlessGod()` — call at the top of a test to skip
cleanly when the capability is absent.

## Persona factories (`e2e/personas/factories.ts`)

All take a `Page` bound to the right app and drive the real UI. Emails are unique
per worker (`e2e/lib/identity.ts`) so parallel runs never collide.

| Factory                   | Signature                                                       | Returns             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `signUpBurner`            | `(page, { onboard?, username? }?)`                              | `Account`           | web app. Handles verification-off (synthetic email, auto sign-in) **and** verification-on (disposable inbox + link) transparently. `onboard:true` chains `completeBio`.                        |
| `completeBio`             | `(page, { username?, homeCity? }?)`                             | `{ username }`      | Walks the 5-step Burner Bio; releases the onboarding gate. Idempotent if already complete. **Nothing in the bio is required** — pass `username: null` to prove the flow completes without one. |
| `signInAs`                | `(page, { email, password }, app?)`                             | `void`              | `app` = `"web" \| "org" \| "suppliers"` (default web). Asserts success by leaving the sign-in route (copy is enumeration-safe).                                                                |
| `signOut`                 | `(page)`                                                        | `void`              | Header sign-out.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `createCamp`              | `(page, { name?, description?, joinability? }?)`                | `{ slug, name }`    | web. Creator becomes structural **lead**. Requires an onboarded session. Creates a `theme_camp`.                                                                                               |
| `inviteToCamp`            | `(page, slug, kind?)`                                           | `{ token, url }`    | `kind` = `"member"` (default) \| `"lead_transfer"`. Reads the invite URL from the rendered `<code>`.                                                                                           |
| `joinByInvite`            | `(page, tokenOrUrl)`                                            | `{ slug }`          | Redeems as the current onboarded user.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `acceptInviteAsNewBurner` | `(page, tokenOrUrl, { username? }?)`                            | `{ account, slug }` | The **signed-out** journey: opens the link with no session, accepts, creates the account, clears the Burner Bio gate, and lands on the camp. Handles verification-on/off like `signUpBurner`.  |
| `submitRegistration`      | `(page, slug, input?)`                                          | `void`              | Fills **all six** wizard sections and submits; asserts "Registration submitted". Completeness mirrors `packages/core` `SECTION_PREDICATES` exactly. Overridable fields in `RegistrationInput`. |
| `registerSupplier`        | `(page, { email?, businessName?, contactPerson?, category? }?)` | `Account`           | suppliers app. Pass `email` overlapping a seeded catalog row to exercise **claim-by-email**; omit for a fresh row.                                                                             |
| `elevateToGod`            | `(orgPage)`                                                     | `{ email }`         | Signs the **pre-provisioned** god account in and triggers the GOD_EMAILS bootstrap. **Not** self-service (see below). Throws `GodUnavailableError` if creds absent.                            |

`Account = { email, password, name, mailbox? }`. `mailbox` (a live disposable
inbox) is present only when the account was created against real mail capture.

## Mail capture (`e2e/lib/mail.ts`)

- `createMailbox(hint?)` / `requireMailbox(hint?)` → `Mailbox` with
  `waitForMessage(match?)` and `waitForLink(pattern, match?)`.
- Strategy: **mail.tm disposable inboxes** (roadmap M3-17 decision). It exercises
  the **real** delivery path (app → Resend → DNS → inbox) and needs **no product
  code change**. Email verification is currently **off**, so mail is unavailable
  by default and link-dependent flows skip (`skipUnlessMail()`); they light up the
  moment `E2E_MAIL_MODE=mailtm` and the deployment has a Resend key.
- **Rejected** alternatives, and the guardrail if one is ever adopted: a test-only
  "peek the latest token" endpoint (option c) is a product-code auth side-door — we
  do **not** ship it. If nightly flakiness ever forces it, it MUST be secret-gated,
  MUST hard-refuse when the secret is unset, and MUST arrive with a route-census
  entry and a test asserting the refusal. Mailpit/MailHog (option b) can't be
  reached from a Vercel preview, so it would stop testing the real deployment.
  `getTestInstance()`/`getOTP()` (option d) is in-process only — useless against a
  deployed preview.

## Google & god access — honest limitations

- **Google OAuth is NOT E2E-tested.** Real Google sign-in cannot be driven
  headlessly in CI (bot detection, consent screens, 2FA), and mocking the provider
  callback would require a product-code side-door we refuse to ship. The
  "Continue with Google" button's presence/wiring can be asserted, but a full
  OAuth round trip is **out of automated scope** — state this loudly rather than
  imply coverage. `E2E_GOOGLE_DRIVEABLE` exists only for a bespoke local run with a
  throwaway Google account you accept the fragility of.
- **God cannot be minted through the UI — by design.** `resolveOrgSession`
  bootstraps `god` only for an email that is on `GOD_EMAILS` **and** verified
  (`packages/core` `canBootstrapGod`). A fresh random sign-up is never verified
  when mail is off. So org-console (god) journeys need a **pre-provisioned**
  account: set `E2E_GOD_EMAIL`/`E2E_GOD_PASSWORD` for an account whose email is in
  the deployment's `GOD_EMAILS` and already verified (via Google once, or via mail
  capture on a `mailtm` deployment). Absent → `elevateToGod` throws and god specs
  `skipUnlessGod()`.

  **Provisioning one for a local run.** `e2e:local` defaults `GOD_EMAILS` to
  `e2e-god@quagga.local` and there is no mail provider, so nothing can verify that
  address through the product. Sign the account up through the real endpoint, then
  flip the flag directly in SQL — the one place the harness reaches past the UI, and
  only to stand in for a mail round trip the environment cannot perform:

  ```bash
  docker exec quagga-pg psql -U postgres -d quagga \
    -c "UPDATE \"user\" SET email_verified = true WHERE email = 'e2e-god@quagga.local';"
  ```

  Then set `E2E_GOD_EMAIL` / `E2E_GOD_PASSWORD` to that account. The bootstrap fires
  on its next sign-in. Do **not** generalise this into a fixture that grants ranks
  directly — every rank above god's bootstrap must still be granted through the real
  Accounts UI, which is what the org-console specs are there to prove.

## Persona registry (`e2e/personas/registry.ts`)

The **single** source of the authz matrix. `PERSONAS[kind]` gives `{ allowed,
forbidden }` capabilities; `forbiddenMatrix()` yields every (persona, forbidden
capability) pair for the negative-path suite (M3-30). Each forbidden capability
carries a `refusalHint` naming the server guard to prove — the assertion is always
"the guard **refuses**", never "the link is hidden". `HARD_LOCKED_PRIVATE_FIELDS`
mirrors `packages/core/src/privacy.ts` (source of truth; the PII-projection guard
pins the canonical list).

## Cleanup / isolation

Isolation within a run is by construction: unique-per-worker emails and
per-spec-created data, no shared fixtures. Full teardown is **environmental**, not
per-test — there is no destructive DB helper here, and the only writer is the app,
exactly as a real user.

- **Locally**, rows accumulate: a full run leaves ~90 burner accounts, camps and
  registrations in the compose database, and repeated runs make screens like the org
  access roster unrepresentatively long. `E2E_RESET_DB=1 pnpm e2e:local` drops and
  rebuilds it. That reset drops **both** the `public` **and** `drizzle` schemas —
  dropping only `public` leaves the migration tracker behind, and the migrator then
  reports "up to date" against an empty database, a silent no-op that looks like
  success and fails much later.
- **In CI**, the suite runs against a throwaway Neon branch behind a preview, deleted
  on completion (auth-spec §5.2 / roadmap M3-31). Leaked rows on an ephemeral branch
  are cheaper than a UI-driven teardown that would itself need auth.

## CI wiring (M3-31 — downstream of this harness)

This section described a plan. What actually ships is in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and it is different — recorded here so the two do
not disagree:

- **PR and push to main:** the WHOLE suite on `desktop-chromium`, split into
  eight per-persona jobs so a red job names what broke. Blocking. Runs against a
  local stack the job stands up itself (Postgres + the two Neon proxies via
  `docker-compose.local.yml`), not against a Vercel preview — so there is no
  preview URL, no bypass header and no Neon branch involved.
- **Nightly (02:00 UTC) and `workflow_dispatch`:** the same eight personas on
  `mobile-360`. NOT on pull requests: every mobile spec is of unknown status and
  was written against a desktop layout, so it would put eight red crosses on
  every PR until triage is done, and a check that is always red teaches people
  to ignore checks. Reports upload under `mobile-*`.
- Traces, screenshots, the HTML report AND the app server log upload on every
  job, pass or fail (`playwright-report-<persona>` / `mobile-<persona>`).

The plan's smoke-only PR gate was abandoned deliberately: a gate that runs three
specs cannot catch a permission regression, which is the class of bug this suite
exists for.

## Selector traps (each of these cost a debugging session)

Every one of these produced a failure that _looked_ like a product bug. The specs
were authored against source, never against a live DOM, so the whole class went
unnoticed until the suite was first executed.

- **`getByRole("alert")` can never resolve to one element.** Next injects
  `<div role="alert" id="__next-route-announcer__">` into every page, so a bare
  alert query always matches it too — and `toHaveCount(0)` can never pass. Use
  `appAlerts(page)` from `lib/dom.ts`.
- **A `required` field's label contains the asterisk.** `Labeled` renders
  `{label}<span aria-hidden>*</span>`, so the accessible name is
  `"Contact email *"` and `getByLabel("Contact email", { exact: true })` matches
  nothing. Use a prefix regex: `getByLabel(/^contact email/i)`.
- **Burner Bio text fields collide with their own privacy switch.** The switch's
  aria-label is `"Home city — public or private"`, so `getByLabel(/home city/i)`
  is a strict-mode violation. Scope to the control:
  `getByRole("textbox", { name: /home city/i })`. (The **Username** field is the
  one exception — it has no privacy switch, because a unique public handle has
  no honest "private" state — but use the same `getByRole("textbox", …)` form
  anyway so every bio selector reads alike.)
- **A username is not a display name.** `uniqueName()` emits spaces, capitals and
  hyphens; the field rejects all three. Use `uniqueUsername()` (`lib/identity.ts`)
  for anything typed into the Username box, and remember handles are unique
  ACROSS THE WHOLE DATABASE — a collision surfaces as "That username is already
  taken" inside whatever factory happened to run second.
- **`toHaveCount(0)` right after `toHaveURL` proves nothing.** `toHaveURL`
  resolves the instant the URL changes — before the destination has painted — so
  the next assertion's first poll can land on an empty document, see zero, and
  pass. Four assertions across three specs did exactly this, and one of them
  (`camp-member-forbidden`) had been green for months on a page it never
  actually looked at; it went red only when the dashboard rendered fast enough
  to be there, and read as a flake. **Assert something PRESENT before asserting
  anything absent** — a member-only control, the empty state, the 404's own
  copy. It also caught a false claim: a comment asserting the page "actually
  rendered (not a 404 masquerading as absence)" was checking that an error
  message was _absent_, which is equally true of a blank page.
- **`.click()` is not "the request finished".** It resolves when the event is
  dispatched. Navigating straight afterwards raced the sign-up POST and the
  session cookie did not exist yet, so the gate bounced to sign-in and ~100
  specs blamed the product. The sign-up factories now wait for the response AND
  for the cookie to actually land (`waitForSessionCookie`).
- **Create-camp soft-warns on a near-duplicate name** and needs a second,
  confirming submit. `uniqueCampName` varies a suffix rather than the stem, so
  once the database holds a few camps a near-match is close to certain.
