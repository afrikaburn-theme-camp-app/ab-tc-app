The codebase is deliberately deploy-ready-but-unconfigured: all three apps build and
boot with zero env vars. **Migrations apply automatically on deploy** — every app's
`build` runs `db:migrate:deploy` before `next build`, so as soon as the DB env is set
the committed migrations (`packages/db/migrations/0000_*` … `0029_*`) are applied by
the build. With no DB env (a fork, a preview without env, CI) the migrator prints a
skip line and exits 0, so the build still succeeds. This is the order of operations
for the first real deployment.

**There is no manual data step any more.** The same deploy runner also **bootstraps
the reference data** — it seeds only when it finds `editions` empty _(the
first real deployment came up with a perfect schema, working Google sign-in and no
active edition, so every DB-backed page fell through to "Preview mode" — which
reads as a configuration problem when the configuration was correct. Seeding was a
manual step nothing told you about, and the person who needed to run it could not:
the connection string is a secret they cannot copy out of Vercel.)_

**It is a bootstrap, not a sync.** A database that already has an edition is left
alone. Camp categories and supplier records are editable in the org console, and
re-asserting canonical rows on every deploy would quietly revert an organiser's edits
or resurrect something they deleted.

On the **first** deploy the migrator applies 0000–0029 and seeds, all in a single
advisory-locked run — **watch the Vercel build log** for the `[migrate]` lines to
confirm which connection it used, that every migration applied, and whether it printed
`no edition found — seeding reference data` or `reference data present — not re-seeding`.

## 1. Neon

1. Create a Neon project (e.g. `afrikaburn-contributors`). Copy the **pooled** connection string → `DATABASE_URL`, and the **direct/unpooled** connection string → `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`. The deploy migrator needs the unpooled one (its advisory lock does not hold on Neon's pooled PgBouncer endpoint); the apps use the pooled one at runtime.
2. Auth is now **self-hosted Better Auth** (`@quagga/auth`, mounted per app at `/api/auth/[...all]`) against this same Neon DB — managed Neon Auth is not used. Generate one shared `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -base64 32`) and set the **identical** value on all three projects (a session signed by one app must verify in another). Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` per app to its own apex origin in production (previews derive it from `VERCEL_URL`).
3. Add Google as an OAuth provider (Google Cloud Console OAuth client) and set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`; the callback is `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/google`. Email+password works without this. Email verification and password-reset delivery switch on automatically once `RESEND_API_KEY` is set (until then verification is not required and reset presents as honestly unavailable).

## 2. Reference data — automatic, nothing to do

Neither migrations nor the seed are run by hand here any more: the deploy build
applies the migrations and bootstraps the reference data on an empty database (see
the top of this doc). **You should not need this section for a normal deployment.**

For a **local** database, run both explicitly:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
pnpm --filter @quagga/db db:migrate:deploy
pnpm --filter @quagga/db db:seed          # reference data only — see below
```

Seeding is idempotent, so it is safe to re-run. `pnpm --filter @quagga/db db:migrate`
(drizzle-kit) also still exists for a local DB; it is **never** run against production
by a person.

### What the seed does and does not contain

**Binding principle: seeds contain ONLY org-owned
reference/catalog data. Every burner, camp, membership, registration and
questionnaire response — in every environment, including the kickoff demo — is
created live through the app.**

Seeded: the **edition** (AfrikaBurn 2027, 26 Apr – 2 May 2027), the **org group**
"AfrikaBurn" (no memberships — staff elevate live via `GOD_EMAILS`), the **8
canonical camp categories**, the **supplier repository** (the scrubbed AB sheet
snapshot + each supplier's per-edition onboarding step map, `user_id` deliberately
`null` so a real supplier can self-register and claim the row by email overlap),
and **one org-authored questionnaire template** (`org-safety-checkin-2027` —
definition only, no activation, no audience, no responses).

Not seeded, ever: users, burner bios, theme camps / artworks / mutant vehicles,
memberships, invites, registrations, supplier declarations, section reviews,
questionnaire activations / required actions / responses, notifications,
bulletins, audit events, supplier notes. And **no payments** — AfrikaBurn never
receives payment from theme camps; registration is free. The `payments` table
stays frozen in the schema for future logistics apps.

Consequences worth knowing: an empty directory, an empty registrations queue and
an empty status board are the **correct** first-boot state. The first rows appear
when a human signs up.

## 3. Resend

Create an API key → `RESEND_API_KEY`. Without it, all email logs to the server console
(fine for local, not for the live demo). Verify a sending domain or use Resend's test
sender for the MVP.

## 4. Vercel — three projects, one repo

| Project                             | Root Directory   | Port locally |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `afrikaburn-contributors-web`       | `apps/web`       | 3000         |
| `afrikaburn-contributors-org`       | `apps/org`       | 3001         |
| `afrikaburn-contributors-suppliers` | `apps/suppliers` | 3002         |

All three depend on `@quagga/db`, so any committed migration invalidates all three
builds and each one applies migrations on deploy — that is intentional. Safety comes
from the advisory lock in `db:migrate:deploy`, not from nominating one owner app.

- Build command: leave default — each app's `build` script already runs
  `db:migrate:deploy && next build`. **Do not remove the migrate step.** Watch the
  `[migrate]` lines in the build log on the first deploy.
- Install command: `pnpm install` at repo root (Vercel detects the monorepo; if needed set it explicitly).
- Env vars on **all three** projects: `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (the
  direct endpoint — the migrator's advisory lock does not hold on the pooled one),
  `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (identical across all three), `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (per app),
  `AUTH_APEX_DOMAIN` (identical across all three — the shared registrable domain
  the three apps are subdomains of, e.g. `example.org`; unset means no cross-app
  SSO cookie/passkey scoping, each app behaves as its own origin),
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PGCRYPTO_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`,
  `GOD_EMAILS`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (web only, from a Vercel Blob store).
- Env vars for the **in-app reporter** (all three projects; every one of them is
  optional and the app boots without them — see §4a).
- **Never set `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` / `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` on a real
  deployment.** They exist to _raise_ the auth limiter's ceiling for a test
  environment where every Playwright worker hammers sign-up from one address. Setting
  them in production disables the protection that is doing its job.

## 4a. The in-app reporter

Signed-in people can file a bug or feature request from inside any of the three
apps. The server turns it into a **public GitHub issue** on this repository,
created by the token below and labelled `needs-triage` + `source: in-app`.

Read that sentence again before setting `GITHUB_TOKEN`: **every issue the
reporter files is authored by whoever owns the token**, from words somebody else
typed. The issue body says so on every issue, and the label carries the same
warning, but the GitHub account on it is yours.

| Variable            | Effect when unset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`      | The reporter is not offered at all: no corner button, and the Account page says reporting is switched off rather than taking a report it cannot file. Fine-grained PAT, **Issues: read and write**, scoped to the repository named by `GITHUB_REPO` (or the default below) and nothing else. |
| `GITHUB_REPO`       | Defaults to `afrikaburn-theme-camp-app/ab-tc-app`. `owner/repo`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Reports are filed from a plain template instead of being restructured into title / steps / expected / actual. Nothing is lost.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`      | The microphone is hidden and the reporter is typing-only. Used for Whisper transcription only.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Two things follow from the reporter being public-facing:

1. **Run `pnpm labels:sync` once** against the target repository (needs
   `GITHUB_TOKEN` locally). It creates the label taxonomy the reporter applies.
   Without it GitHub invents grey, undescribed labels on first use.
2. **Personal data.** Reports carry recent client errors and environment info,
   redacted by `@quagga/core` `report-sanitize.ts` before filing. Redaction is
   pattern-based and fails open — it is a second line of defence behind the
   collection caps, not a guarantee. Anything filed should still be read as
   potentially sensitive, and the issue says so.

Rate limits are per account and enforced in the database: 5 reports and 30
transcriptions per hour. The reporter's own account id is **never** written to
the issue; the pairing of issue number to reporter is in the server log only.

**Preview deployments.** Neon preview branching is enabled, so each preview/PR gets
its own Neon branch with its own `DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`. The deploy
migrator runs against that branch — which is correct and desired: every preview
migrates its own isolated branch, never production.

**Those branches are not cleaned up by anyone, and running out of them looks like a
broken build.** The Vercel–Neon integration creates a branch per preview and never
removes it. Once the project hits its branch quota Neon stops issuing new ones, and
Vercel then **rejects the preview deployment in about one second**, before any build
starts — surfacing as three red `Vercel – …` checks on the pull request.

That is a genuinely misleading signal, so recognise it by the clock:

|                 | pending → outcome |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| a real build    | minutes           |
| quota rejection | **~1 second**     |

Production keeps deploying perfectly throughout, because it needs no new branch. The
code is fine. Every local reproduction passes. Diagnosed the hard way on PR #10 (3 Aug 2026) after eliminating the checkout, the build and the migrator one at a time.

`.github/workflows/neon-pr-cleanup.yml` deletes the branch when a PR closes, which
stops the leak going forward. It needs two repository secrets:

- `NEON_API_KEY` — a Neon API key (Account settings → API keys)
- `NEON_PROJECT_ID` — the Neon project id

**It does not clear a backlog.** Branches from PRs that closed before the workflow
existed have to be removed once, by hand, from the Neon console or the API:

```bash
# list the preview branches that are left
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/$NEON_PROJECT_ID/branches" \
  | jq -r '.branches[] | select(.primary != true) | select(.name | startswith("preview/")) | "\(.id)  \(.name)"'
```

Check the list against open PRs before deleting anything, then
`DELETE .../branches/<id>` the ones whose PR has closed. Never touch the primary
branch — that is production, with real burners' registrations in it.

- `GOD_EMAILS=<first-maintainer@example.org>,<second-maintainer@example.org>` — first sign-in with a listed (verified) email self-elevates to god (System manager). **List at least two working-group addresses in production** — a single god account is a lockout risk (the System panel itself warns about this).
- **Optional, web only — `ACCOUNT_SWEEP_SECRET`**: bearer token for
  `/api/account/deletion-sweep`, which sanitizes accounts whose 14-day deletion
  grace period has elapsed (docs/accounts-security-spec.md §Deletion). **Leave it
  unset until you want the sweeper live** — without it the route refuses to run and
  nothing is ever erased. A **Vercel Cron** entry (`apps/web/vercel.json`) hits the
  route daily at 03:00 UTC. Vercel Cron can only GET and authenticates by injecting
  `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`, so **also set `CRON_SECRET`** (web only) for
  the cron to run — the same value as `ACCOUNT_SWEEP_SECRET` is fine. The route
  accepts either secret and still refuses any unauthenticated caller. Crons run on
  production deployments only. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (also optional) is the origin
  used to build email-change confirm/revoke links.
- **Optional, web only — `REGISTRATION_REMINDER_SECRET`**: bearer token for
  `/api/registrations/deadline-reminders`, the job that tells camps with an
  unsubmitted registration that the deadline is 21, 7 or 1 days away (roadmap R1).
  Like the sweeper, the route also accepts `CRON_SECRET`. Unauthenticated callers
  are refused: the job is not destructive, but an open endpoint that emails every
  camp lead is still a spam cannon.

  **Nothing schedules it yet.** There is deliberately no Vercel Cron entry for it —
  it runs only when something calls it. To make it live, either add an entry to
  `apps/web/vercel.json` (daily is enough) or point an external scheduler at
  `GET /api/registrations/deadline-reminders` with the bearer above.

  **It stays silent until someone sets a close date.** The job reads
  `editions.registration_closes_at`; while that is null it reports
  `no_close_date` and sends nothing. Counting down to a date AfrikaBurn has not
  announced would have camps planning around an invented deadline, so this is
  deliberate rather than a gap. Sends are idempotent — one marker per (edition,
  milestone) in `audit_events`, written in the same transaction as the
  notifications, so an at-least-once cron cannot double-notify.

## 5. Smoke test — the live path

There are no seeded accounts to sign in as, by design. The smoke test **creates**
the data it verifies, which is also exactly the kickoff demo script.

1. **Web**: sign up as a real burner (real inbox, verify the email) → complete the
   Burner Bio (exercise a privacy toggle; confirm phone / emergency contacts /
   ID are hard-locked private) → **register Camp 404 through the wizard**, all six
   sections → submit.
2. **Org**: sign in with the `GOD_EMAILS` account (verified email self-elevates to
   god on first sign-in) → the org console lets you in.
3. **Org → Accounts**: elevate a second account to `org_staff`, and a third to
   `engineer`. Confirm the engineer sees no email addresses in the accounts table,
   gets no destructive controls, is refused the medical-access audit panel — and
   _does_ reach `/system`, which `org_staff` does not. The ranks are jobs, not a
   ladder; this is the step that proves it.
   3b. **Org → /system**: confirm every env check reads as expected and that the
   database probe reports a live round trip. It never prints a secret.
4. **Org → Registrations**: Camp 404 is in the queue on `submitted`. Walk the real
   review loop — request changes on a section, watch the notification land on the
   camp side, resolve it, approve.
5. **Suppliers**: self-register a supplier against an email that overlaps a seeded
   catalog row (claim-by-email) and one that doesn't (fresh row); walk the
   onboarding steps and a document acknowledgement.

Every smoke assertion is against **live-created** rows. Nothing is verified
against a seeded row, because no user-generated seeded row exists.
