Three Next apps, one Postgres, one account pool. This describes what is deployed
today. Where it conflicts with [`build-spec.md`](build-spec.md), the build spec
wins — it is the engineering contract; this is the map. (Full precedence chain,
App Specification included: [`README.md`](README.md).)

## System

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph apps["Three front doors · Vercel"]
        web["apps/web<br/>participant"]
        org["apps/org<br/>organiser console"]
        sup["apps/suppliers<br/>supplier portal"]
    end

    subgraph pkgs["Shared workspace packages"]
        core["@quagga/core<br/>domain rules"]
        auth["@quagga/auth<br/>Better Auth 1.6.25"]
        db["@quagga/db<br/>schema · migrations"]
        ui["@quagga/ui<br/>components"]
    end

    neon[("Neon Postgres<br/>44 tables · 30 migrations")]

    subgraph ext["External services — all optional"]
        resend["Resend<br/>email"]

    end

    web & org & sup --> core & auth & db & ui
    auth --> neon
    db --> neon
    web --> resend & blob
    org --> resend
    web & org & sup --> gh
    gh -.-> claude

    classDef app fill:#2D7696,stroke:#235C75,color:#fff
    classDef pkg fill:#26333B,stroke:#323A3F,color:#F4F0E8

```

**Every external service is optional and degrades in the open.** No
`RESEND_API_KEY` and email is skipped; no `GITHUB_TOKEN` and the reporter is not
offered; no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and reports file from a plain template; no
`GROQ_API_KEY` and dictation is hidden. The apps boot and serve without any of
them — the env-less boot law in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Package dependencies

Strictly one-directional. An app may import anything; nothing imports an app.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    types["@quagga/types"] --> core["@quagga/core"]
    types --> db["@quagga/db"]
    types --> ui["@quagga/ui"]
    types --> auth["@quagga/auth"]
    core --> db
    core --> ui
    core --> auth
    db --> auth
    core & db & ui & auth --> apps["apps/web · apps/org · apps/suppliers"]
```

Two rules hold this shape:

| Rule                                                   | Why                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@quagga/core` never imports `@quagga/db`              | Domain rules stay pure and testable; the 872 core tests need no database.                                                                     |
| `@quagga/core/report-server` is a separate export path | It reads `GITHUB_TOKEN` and pulls the Anthropic SDK. Re-exporting it from the barrel would ship the filing machinery to every browser bundle. |

## A request

No middleware. Every app resolves its own session in a server component and
decides what the visitor may see.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser
    participant L as Route-group layout
    participant S as lib/session.ts
    participant A as auth package
    participant D as Neon

    B->>L: GET /some/page
    L->>S: resolve session
    S->>A: read cookie
    A->>D: session lookup
    D-->>A: user or null
    A-->>S: authenticated user
    S->>D: role / membership / gate reads
    D-->>S: viewer state
    alt refused
        S-->>L: gate state
        L-->>B: full-screen gate, no page body
    else allowed
        L-->>B: chrome + page
    end
```

Each app's gate answers a different question:

| App              | Gate                                                | Refusal                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web`       | Is onboarding complete? Any blocking questionnaire? | Blocking flow replaces the page                 |
| `apps/org`       | Does this account hold an org role?                 | `GateScreen` — "restricted to AfrikaBurn staff" |
| `apps/suppliers` | Has this verified email claimed a listing?          | `GateScreen` — unlinked account                 |

Pages re-guard before reading. Hiding a control is never the security boundary.

## Data

44 tables in one database, owned by `packages/db`. Migrations are append-only
and run on deploy (`db:migrate:deploy && next build`) — **against production,
with no staging step.**

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users ||--o| burnerBios : "profile"
    users ||--o{ memberships : "joins"
    groups ||--o{ memberships : "roster"
    groups ||--o{ invites : "issues"
    groups ||--|| registrations : "submits"
    registrations ||--o{ sectionReviews : "reviewed in"
    sectionReviews ||--o{ sectionReviewReplies : "replied to"
    registrations ||--o| wranglerAssignments : "shepherded by"
    users ||--o{ orgRoleAssignments : "staff"
    orgDepartments ||--o{ orgRoles : "defines"
    questionnaireDefinitions ||--o{ questionnaireActivations : "sent as"
    questionnaireActivations ||--o{ questionnaireResponses : "answered"
    suppliers ||--o{ supplierDocuments : "uploads"
    suppliers ||--o| supplierOnboarding : "progresses"
    users ||--o{ notifications : "receives"
    bulletins ||--o{ notifications : "fans out to"
    users ||--o{ auditEvents : "recorded in"
```

Four clusters: **identity** (users, sessions, 2FA, passkeys, bios, deletion and
email-change requests), **camps** (groups, memberships, invites, roles,
registrations, reviews, wranglers), **programme** (questionnaires, bulletins,
notifications, categories), **suppliers** (listings, onboarding, documents,
declarations). `auditEvents` spans all four.

## Constraints worth knowing before changing anything

- **The deployment is live**, with real participants' phone numbers, emergency
  contacts and medical notes in it. There is no staging database.
- **Migrations are append-only.** An applied migration cannot be edited, only
  corrected by another one. `packages/db/migrations/` is CODEOWNERS-gated.
- **Sessions are per-app.** One account pool, but cookies do not cross
  `*.vercel.app` — the Public Suffix List forbids it. Shared sign-on needs a
  custom apex; see [`auth-platform-spec.md`](auth-platform-spec.md).
- **There is no public API.** Every route handler under `apps/*/app/api/` is better-auth,
  blob upload, the in-app reporter or a sweep — all data access is server actions and
  server components behind cookie sessions. An external, key-authenticated `/v1` surface is
  specified in [`docs/sdk/`](sdk/README.md) and **is not built**; when it lands it is the
  first inbound authenticated arrow on the diagram above.
- **Personal data has classes**, enforced in `@quagga/core`: some Bio fields can
  never be public, medical notes require recorded consent, and reads of them are
  audited. A copy of one of those predicates outside `core` is the same risk as
  changing the original.
