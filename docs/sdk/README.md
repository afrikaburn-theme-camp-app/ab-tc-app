# Quagga Portal SDK — specification

A proposal for `@afrikaburn/sdk`: a published npm package that lets third-party projects
talk to the Quagga Portal backend, where **the API key's rights decide which of the SDK's
methods work**.

**Status: specification. Nothing here is built.** The first reference
consumer envisioned is a camp-specific app outside this monorepo, alongside
other such apps.

> **Draft.** This whole tree depends on App Specification Decision 005
> (backend-first API/SDK direction), which is still `proposed`, not
> accepted. Nothing here should be read as settled scope until that record
> is resolved — see `docs/technical-spec/README.md`'s drift register and
> `GOVERNANCE.md`.

`06-review.md` contains a review arguing this was too early. A maintainer
has since named a consumer and asked for it, which answers the review's
scheduling question for as long as this remains one maintainer's
prioritisation call rather than a working-group decision — that distinction
matters once Decision 005 is actually resolved. The review is kept for its
technical findings, which stand.

## Delegation

The hard problem is not what a key may do; it is proving the **burner is actually there**
when an app outside this repo acts for them. `04-backend-work-required.md` §4.3.12 took a
bare `subjectUserId` and was found to be an impersonation primitive over every burner
(`06-review.md`, C1). [`delegation/`](delegation/README.md) replaces it with a relay ticket
that points at the burner's live session row, and covers the audit, security measures,
auditing procedures, doc/process edits and the Camp 404 retrofit.

## The one-paragraph version

An API key is a **ceiling, never a principal**. It names no burner and on its own reaches
nothing but public data; a request that can name one must also carry a **relay ticket**
pointing at that burner's live session row, so effective rights are `ticket ∩ consent ∩
ceiling` intersected with the END USER's live rights, recomputed every request. A demoted
membership therefore collapses its keys with no sweep job. Rights reach the client as a
**server-issued capability manifest** — a document produced by the predicates that already
exist in `@quagga/core`, never a copy of those predicates. The published package therefore
contains **no authorisation logic at all**: 50 closed scope strings, generated method stubs,
a manifest evaluator and response DTOs. `org-permissions.ts`, `project-permissions.ts` and
`privacy.ts` stay here, stay FSL-1.1-ALv2, and are never published — because
`org-permissions.ts:22-25` already records what a second source of truth for permissions
costs. The local gate is developer experience; the server's 403 is the boundary.

_(An earlier draft of this paragraph described a synthetic **service user** whose rights the
key intersected. `delegation/00-decision.md` rejects that model outright — it deletes the
service user, the `users.kind` column it needed, and the insider-issues-themselves-a-key
path with it. The relay ticket above is the design.)_

## Provenance, and what has actually been verified

This spec was produced by a 27-agent investigation. Two honesty notes belong on the front page.

**An earlier run of the same investigation was discarded in full.** A harness fault rejected
all 312 of its tool calls, so 27 agents produced a confident, detailed and entirely ungrounded
architecture without reading a single file. None of it survives here. The re-run made a
successful read of a known file each agent's mandatory first action, with instructions to
abort rather than reason from priors — it landed 942 tool calls with 3 errors.

**Verified by hand** (not merely asserted by an agent):

- `packages/core/src/privacy.ts:39-47` — `HARD_LOCKED_PRIVATE_FIELDS`, exactly 7 fields.
- `packages/core/src/project-permissions.ts:53` — the `manage_roles ⇒ assign_roles` implication.
- `packages/core/src/org-permissions.ts:178-182`, `:438-440`, `:521`, `:621`, `:809` —
  `orgRankFromRole`, `isSystemManager`, `orgCanInDomain`, `orgCapabilityRefusal`, `summarizeOrgActor`.
- `apps/web/lib/groups-store.ts:187` — the free-camp law, literally `if (!registered && !viewerRole) continue;`.
- `apps/org/lib/queries.ts:952-960` — `REGISTRATION_CONTACT_KEYS`, 7 contact columns that sit
  **outside** `HARD_LOCKED_PRIVATE_FIELDS` and are guarded today by a module-private `const`.
- `grep -rn stripHardLocked` returns **zero hits** — the PII stripper that
  `docs/technical-spec/01-auth-and-identity.md` §9.4 decision 2 committed to was never built.

**Not verified, and flagged in place:** every claim about `better-auth`'s api-key plugin
(`node_modules` is absent from this environment), the exact store line counts, and the
prior-art citations in the external research. Treat those as leads.

## What this investigation found that has nothing to do with the SDK

The most valuable output is arguably a set of first-party defects the sweep turned up, listed
in `06-review.md`. The sharpest is **fixed in this same branch**: `apps/web/lib/medical-access.ts`
resolved `orgRankFromRole(actorOrgRole) ?? "org_staff"`, fabricating a rank that
`apps/org/lib/session.ts` treats as forbidden — two apps, one input, two answers, on a
medical-notes path. A null rank now skips the org branch entirely, and `strongestOrgRole`
stops an ordinary org row overwriting an `engineer` and erasing its carve-out.

Two remain open and depend on nothing here: `REGISTRATION_CONTACT_KEYS` is still a
module-private `const` inside `apps/org`, and the unconditional PII stripper
`docs/technical-spec/01-auth-and-identity.md` §9.4 decision 2 committed to is still unbuilt.
