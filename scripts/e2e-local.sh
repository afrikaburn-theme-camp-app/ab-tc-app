#   dev   (default locally) — `next dev`, so a code change is picked up without
#         a rebuild. The right choice while you are iterating on a spec.
#   build (default in CI)   — `next build` once, then `next start`.
#
# THE COST OF `dev` IS NOT SMALL. Next compiles each route ON FIRST REQUEST, and
# there are 65 pages across the three apps. Every spec that visits a page nobody
# has visited yet pays a multi-second compile, several parallel workers can block
# on the SAME cold compile at once, and a compile that overruns the 20s
# navigation cap surfaces as a timeout that looks exactly like a product bug.
# That is most of why the first CI run crawled.
#
# `build` also tests what actually ships: the production bundle, with the same
# route handlers Vercel serves.

# therefore left a server listening, the next run's `next start` failed to bind,
# and the readiness loop below said "ok" because SOMETHING answered :3000. The
# suite then ran against the previous run's build. Measured 28 Jul 2026: five
