# AGENTS.md

Operating guide for AI agents working in this repo. It is a **digest**: the
commands, hard engineering rules and canvas mechanics an agent needs on hand,
distilled from the standing sources of truth below. It never overrides them.

`README.md` has the product overview; `GOVERNANCE.md` has how decisions get
made and by whom; `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the human-facing process guide this
file assumes. **The App Specification** (authoritative on Superhuman, local
working copy at [`docs/sources/app-specification/`](docs/sources/app-specification/README.md)
— see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)) governs what the product should do.
Where anything in this repo conflicts with it, the App Specification wins,
Decision Records aside. Below that: `GOVERNANCE.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` govern
process, `docs/technical-spec/` and `docs/build-spec.md` govern engineering
HOW, and this file is the agent digest — it must not contradict any of the
above.

## Read this first

**This product is LIVE.** Real AfrikaBurn participants, real camps, and real personal
information — phone numbers, emergency contacts, medical notes, identity documents.
There is no staging environment. Three things follow, and none of them are optional:

1. **Never test against the deployed apps.** Run the stack locally (`pnpm e2e:local`)
   — it seeds fake data and contains no real person. Creating an account or a camp on
   the live site to check a theory is not a shortcut, it is production data.
2. **A migration you merge runs against production on the next deploy.** There is no
   step in between that would catch it. **So never hand-write one** — edit
   `schema.ts` and run `db:generate`, and commit the snapshot it writes alongside
   the SQL. Hand-authoring is not a shortcut, it is the thing that breaks the
   generator for everyone after you: it leaves no snapshot, so the next
   `db:generate` diffs against a stale database and emits a migration that
   re-creates tables that already exist. If the generator's output looks absurd,
   the snapshot chain is broken — repair it, do not write around it. Rule 1 under
   Hard engineering rules has the detail and the repair recipe.
3. **This is a shared, community-owned repository.** Branch, open a pull request,
   and get a code-owner review — never commit to `main`. (Branch protection is
   deliberately not switched on yet — see `GOVERNANCE.md` for when it turns on —
   so nothing _stops_ you. That makes the rule more important, not less.)

If you find a security or privacy problem, report it privately — `SECURITY.md`.

**Human contributors start at `CONTRIBUTING.md`**; it covers setup, the commit
convention and the designer workflow. `GOVERNANCE.md` covers who decides what
and how. This file is the agent digest and must not contradict either. (The
full precedence chain, App Spec included, is in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).)

## What this is

The AfrikaBurn Contributors App ("Quagga Portal" — name still pending the working
group): a three-app Turborepo serving burners, the AfrikaBurn org, and suppliers.
Kickoff-driven, spec-first, public repo, **FSL-1.1-ALv2** (Functional Source License,
converting to Apache 2.0 two years after each release — see `LICENSE`).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build   # THE gate — must be green before any commit
pnpm e2e:local                             # the OTHER gate — real DB, real browser
pnpm e2e:local specs/new-burner            # ...or one persona
pnpm --filter @quagga/web dev              # or org / suppliers
pnpm --filter @quagga/db db:generate       # schema.ts → migration + snapshot. NEVER hand-write one.
./scripts/install-safe-chain.sh           # once per machine — wraps pnpm (malware + 48h age gate). CI uses --ci.
./scripts/verify-safe-chain.sh            # canary: must refuse Aikido's safe-chain-test (CI job safe-chain).
```

**The unit gate does not run a single browser.** `turbo run … test` lints and
typechecks `@quagga/e2e` but never executes Playwright, so the persona suite — 176
tests across 70 spec files and 8 personas — proves nothing until `pnpm e2e:local`
runs them. It brings up Postgres + the two
Neon proxies (`docker-compose.local.yml`), migrates, seeds, boots all three apps
and runs the suite. **Run it for anything touching auth, sessions, privacy
projection, or the invite round trip** — a whole class of defect is invisible to
static analysis. The sign-up dead-end (a live session behind a "check your
inbox" message that no deployment without a mail provider could ever satisfy)
passed lint, typecheck, unit tests and build, and died on first contact with a
browser.

Four traps that already cost real time:

- **A long-lived `next dev` keeps a stale module graph.** Delete a file that
  something imports and the running server serves 500s _while `turbo build`
  stays green_ — once producing 104 phantom E2E failures that read exactly like
  product bugs. `e2e:local` always restarts dev and aborts on
  `Module not found`. If you are running dev by hand, restart it after deleting
  or moving a module.
- **Local Postgres is not Neon.** The proxies are faithful enough to catch
  logic, not pooling behaviour or cold starts. Green locally is strong evidence,
  never proof for production.
- **Watch the disk, and do not undo `turbo.json`'s output excludes.** `.next/dev`
  holds unbounded Turbopack state. It was once counted as build output, so every
  build archived a fresh copy: about a dozen build-and-test cycles reached
  ~550 GB and filled a real machine. `!.next/dev/**` in `turbo.json` and the
  cleanup in `scripts/e2e-local.sh` are what stop it — both carry the incident in
  a comment. If you are running many build cycles, `df -h` occasionally.
- **Clean up git worktrees.** Agent runs that use `isolation: "worktree"` leave
  full checkouts behind; ten of them were once sitting at 2.3 GB. `git worktree
list`, then `git worktree remove` what has finished.

## Hard engineering rules

1. **Migrations are GENERATED, never hand-written, committed append-only, and
   applied automatically at deploy time by the advisory-locked runner.** Edit
   `schema.ts`, run `db:generate`, commit both the SQL and its
   `meta/NNNN_snapshot.json`.

   > **Never hand-author a migration.** It is what breaks `db:generate`: a
   > hand-written file leaves no snapshot, so drizzle-kit then diffs `schema.ts`
   > against a stale picture of the database and emits a migration re-creating
   > tables that already exist. This repo learned it the hard way — the chain
   > broke at 0024 (29 Jul 2026) and by 0029 the generator wanted to
   > `CREATE TABLE wrangler_assignments` a second time, which would have failed
   > the production build at deploy. **The generator was never wrong; its input
   > was.** The damage is cumulative: every hand-written migration makes the next
   > generate worse.
   >
   > **If `db:generate` emits something absurd, the snapshot chain is broken —
   > repair it, do not write around it.** Recipe: run `drizzle-kit generate` with
   > the current `schema.ts` against an EMPTY `out/`; it emits a pristine
   > `0000_snapshot.json` that exactly represents `schema.ts`. Renumber it to the
   > latest migration index, set `prevId` to the last real snapshot's `id`, and
   > discard the generated SQL. Verify: `db:generate` must then say "No schema
   > changes, nothing to migrate", and adding a probe column must produce a
   > one-line `ALTER TABLE`.

   At deploy, every app's
   `build` runs `db:migrate:deploy` (`packages/db/src/migrate.ts`) before `next build`:
   it takes a Postgres session advisory lock on the UNPOOLED connection so the three
   concurrent Vercel builds serialise safely, then applies any pending migrations
   (idempotent — drizzle's own table makes the losers no-ops). An ALREADY-COMMITTED
   migration is NEVER edited, NEVER regenerated, and NEVER applied by an agent from a
   developer machine against production — the build is the only thing that applies
   them. (A NEW migration is never hand-authored either — it is generated; see the
   warning above.)
   **The UNPOOLED endpoint is mandatory and ENFORCED, not merely preferred**: the
   runner reads `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (Neon's direct endpoint) first, and it
   _aborts the build_ rather than silently falling back to a pooled URL — because
   session advisory locks do not hold on Neon's PgBouncer (transaction-pooling)
   endpoint, which is what Neon's Vercel integration puts in `DATABASE_URL` by default.
   Specifically it fails hard if the resolved host is a `-pooler`/`pgbouncer` endpoint
   (any env), and, on a `VERCEL_ENV=production` deploy, if `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` is
   unset at all or if no DB is configured at all (a production build that migrates
   nothing is a broken build, not a valid DB-less one). So Vercel env for each app
   must set **both** `DATABASE_URL` (pooled, for the app) and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`
   (direct, for the migrator). Non-production, non-pooler fallback still works (with a
   loud warning) for local dev / Neon Local.
   _(This replaces an earlier "no migration step in any build, ever", which
   over-hardened the real constraint: don't migrate in the very first build, before
   any DB exists. Now that one does, deploy-time migration is the law.
   Amended same day: fallback-to-pooled is a hard failure, not a warning.)_

2. **Migrations are append-only.** Never edit or regenerate an existing migration;
   `packages/db/src/schema.ts` is the single source of truth.
3. **Pins that must not move**: `better-auth` = **1.6.25 exactly** (a DIRECT dependency of
   `@quagga/auth`; verified React 19 / Next 16 / zod 4 / drizzle-orm 0.45.x compatible);
   `@radix-ui/react-slot` ~1.2.4 (newer breaks typecheck/build). _(The old `better-auth = 1.4.18` pin
   lived in `pnpm.overrides` ONLY because better-auth was a transitive dep of managed
   Neon Auth and had to match Neon's internal version. Self-hosting
   (docs/technical-spec/01-auth-and-identity.md) makes better-auth a first-class direct dependency, so the pin now
   lives as the exact version in `packages/auth/package.json` and the override was removed. 1.5+
   also unlocks versioned-secret rotation and the OAuth-provider path.)_ **Never auto-bump
   better-auth**: it has a track record of high-severity auth advisories (GHSA-vp58-j275-797x,
   GHSA-8jhw-6pjj-8723) and we now own the CVE-patch watch — a critical CVE is the one reason to
   move the pin, done deliberately with the gate re-greened, not via Renovate/Dependabot.
4. **All three apps must boot env-less** to a graceful "not configured" state. Never
   add code that crashes the build or boot without env.
5. `turbo` runs `typecheck` after `build` on purpose (Next generates `routes.d.ts`).
   A bare `tsc` in an app dir without a prior build may fail — that's expected.
6. **Prefer prebuilt components** (shadcn ecosystem first) over hand-rolling solved UI
   (phone inputs, accordions, toggle groups…). Hand-rolling solved problems is a defect.
7. TypeScript strict, no `any`; Zod validation on every server action/boundary;
   authz predicates live in `@quagga/core` and are enforced server-side (UI hiding is
   never the security boundary).
8. Vitest covers core logic; add regression tests with every bug fix.
9. **An API key is a ceiling, never a principal.** Nothing under `/v1` exists yet — the
   surface is specified as a Draft in [`docs/sdk/delegation/`](docs/sdk/README.md),
   pending App Spec Decision 005 (proposed: backend-first API/SDK direction). If
   it is ever built, this constraint applies before any code is written this
   way — retrofitting it afterwards is not credible. Every `/v1` request that
   can name a burner would have to resolve, live, on every request:

   ```
   effective = resolve(END USER, live from the DB)
             ∩ key.ceiling
             ∩ scopes that end user consented to THIS integration
   ```

   Two stages, different in kind. The scope intersection is set maths and can only ever
   **subtract**; the decision is still taken by the unchanged `@quagga/core` predicates over
   an actor loaded live for the end user. Nothing widens.

   **Presence is proven, never asserted.** The end user's presence reaches `/v1` as a relay
   ticket whose foreign key is their live `session.id` (`packages/db/src/schema.ts:376-396`),
   minted only behind `requireCampUser()` on our own origin by a click on a consent screen we
   render. **No endpoint accepts a caller-supplied subject identifier, in any form, at any
   version.**

   `org:*` is **not delegable** — not "not issued by default", not expressible. Org-rank
   authority is the console's authority, and a burner clicking a consent screen is not the
   party whose rights are at stake for an org capability.

## Product positions currently built (not permanent law — see the governing Decision Record)

The App Specification and its Decision Records (`docs/sources/app-specification/decisions-record/`)
are what make a product position binding, not this file. Where a position below
still has its Decision Record at `status: proposed`, treat it as this repo's
current build stance, not as settled: changing it needs that record accepted,
not a standing exception in code or docs. See `docs/technical-spec/` for the
per-feature drift register.

- **The platform does not currently hold or process money.** Registration is free —
  AfrikaBurn does not charge theme camps today. No payment UI exists in any
  registration context. Payment _reference tracking_ exists only for future
  logistics apps. Camp-internal member ref codes (`MAH-M017`) are allowed —
  they're the camp's own EFT reconciliation. Governed by Decision 009
  (proposed: payment direction tracking vs. gateway) — a gateway is not ruled
  out by this file, only by that record staying unaccepted.
- **Fewer forms, not more.** Every field must earn its place; derive over ask; carry
  forward by default; progressive disclosure over blanket collection.
- **Privacy classes** (two, both enforced in `@quagga/core` `privacy.ts`, never in
  the UI; both are excluded from EVERY public projection unconditionally):
  - **Hard-locked (`HARD_LOCKED_PRIVATE_FIELDS`)** — phone, both emergency contacts,
    SA ID and passport. NEVER publicly exposable and with **no reveal path of any
    kind**. The ONLY path that shares a phone with the org is an accepted officer
    registration (explicit consent flow).
  - **Safety-visible (`SAFETY_VISIBLE_FIELDS`)** — **medical notes only**. Never
    public, but visible to the audience the burner disclosed them to: leads and
    admins of their OWN camp (a lead of camp A is refused for a member of camp B)
    and org staff.

    **The consent lives at the point of entry.** The field's own label names its
    audience (`MEDICAL_AUDIENCE_NOTE`, shown wherever medical is captured or
    edited). That label is the load-bearing control, exactly as the paper form
    works: disclosing it is what consents to that audience holding it. There is
    **no reveal ceremony** — no reason prompt, no dialog, no per-view notification.
    Friction in an emergency protects nobody.

    What remains, because it costs nothing: encrypted at rest; never in a public
    projection (`canBePublic("medical") === false`, unconditional); never in a
    list, roster, card or export — only on a member's DETAIL view, because casual
    bulk exposure is a different risk from purposeful access; and every disclosing
    read writes an `audit_events` row (`bio.medical.view` — actor,
    subject, basis, timestamp) server-side via `after()`, so the audit never blocks
    or slows the read. That row is a **record, not monitoring**: it answers "who saw
    my medical information?" and lets an incident be reconstructed. Do **not** add
    volume thresholds, per-actor profiling or alerting on top of it — reading many
    members' notes in one sitting is ordinary safety work, and flagging it reports
    normal care as an incident while teaching staff the tool watches them.
    _(An enumeration detector was built and removed for exactly this reason.)_ The authz predicate is
    `canViewMedicalNotes` (`@quagga/core` `medical-access.ts`), enforced server-side.
    _(Disclosing a note to an audience is what consents to that audience holding it.
    This replaces both the earlier hard-lock and the short-lived
    break-glass/reason-prompt design.)_

  - Free camps are undiscoverable to strangers (directory, profiles, type-aheads all
    enforce this) — a repo-built visibility rule the App Specification does not
    itself state; worth a Decision Record of its own before it is treated as
    permanent.
- **Structural roles (`lead`/`admin`) hold every project permission irrevocably** — the
  no-lockout backstop. Custom-role privileges are grants on top.
- **On the org side the same job is done by `memberships.role = 'god'`** (org roles v1,
  migration 0018): console permissions are now DATA — departments, roles and assignments a
  System manager creates — and a god resolves every capability whatever those rows say.
  `manage_accounts` is refused to every role by the resolver itself, and departments/roles/
  assignments are guarded on that anchor rather than on a capability, because the right to
  edit rights must not be grantable. Named lockout tests:
  `apps/org/lib/__tests__/org-role-lockout.test.ts`. The surface is **`/system/roles`,
  inside the System panel** (editing the permission model is "god level account
  management"): `read_system` to READ it, the anchor to CHANGE anything, and the
  people-affected data is not even queried for a reader. Anything that describes what an
  account may do — the accounts table, the assignment dialog, the role editor — renders
  `summarizeOrgActor` from @quagga/core, so the console can never advertise an access it
  would refuse, or understate one it would allow.
- **Not currently in scope**: ticketing (Decision 010, proposed — Quicket
  remains system of record until it is accepted or superseded), placement
  maps (Decisions 011/012, proposed), camp treasuries/dues as a gateway
  (Decision 009, proposed, see above). Changing any of these means moving the
  governing Decision Record forward, not editing this file.
- Blocking questionnaires are labeled explicitly everywhere and gate hard (fill page +
  sign-out only); org-internal questionnaires never leak into the participant app.
- **Seeds contain ONLY org-owned reference/catalog data** (edition, org group, camp
  categories, the two seeded org ROLES, the scrubbed supplier catalog, org questionnaire
  templates). Every burner,
  camp, membership, registration and questionnaire response — in **every** environment,
  including the kickoff demo — is created live through the app. No seeded accounts, ever.
  An empty directory / registrations queue on a fresh DB is the _correct_ first-boot
  state; fix it with honest empty-state copy, never with a seeded row.
  _(See `packages/db/src/seed.ts` header + `docs/deploy.md`.)_

## Verification (how to be right, not just confident)

Nearly every expensive mistake in this repository has the same shape: a plausible
belief, stated as fact, never measured. These are real, all of them recent, and each
one passed a confident review first:

- A migration verified against a live database — inserts, both uniqueness rules, the
  cascade — that still broke **every questionnaire write in the product**. The
  verification never ran an `ON CONFLICT` upsert, which is how the app actually
  writes. _Proving a constraint behaves is not proving the queries that depend on it
  still run._
- A one-line "safety" addition to a session read that tripled a spec's CI failure
  rate. Ten runs on each side of the change found it; reasoning about it did not.
- `.pen` files documented as "encrypted" in three files, taken from a tool's own
  description. `file` says JSON. Nobody had run `file`.
- Three separate wrong diagnoses of the same CI failure, each argued well. The
  answer came from a **timestamp**: a real build takes minutes, and these were dying
  in one second, so nothing was building at all.

So, in this repo:

- **Measure before you claim.** If you are about to write "this is because…", run the
  thing that would show it. A `git log`, a `df -h`, a `file`, two timestamps.
- **Attribute before you blame.** A failing test on your branch is not automatically
  yours, and not automatically flake. Run it on `main`. Run it in isolation. Run it
  several times — a single green run does not disprove a 30% flake rate.
- **A test that cannot fail proves nothing.** After writing a regression test, break
  the thing on purpose and watch it go red. Several tests here say so in a comment
  because that check found them vacuous.
- **A test that passes for the wrong reason is worse than no test**, because it is
  counted. Two shapes have already shipped here, and neither is visible in a coverage
  report — both files reported high coverage while the behaviour was unpinned:
  - **Asserting an absence against a page that has not rendered.** `toHaveURL`
    resolves before the destination paints, so `toHaveCount(0)` after it is satisfied
    by an empty document. Assert something PRESENT first (`e2e/README.md`
    §"Selector traps").
  - **A fixture whose values are outside the domain vocabulary.** A status-board test
    seeded officer assignments with `officerKey: "safety"` and `"lnt"` — neither is in
    the `OfficerKey` enum — so no seeded row ever matched a required slot and the whole
    assignment path was inert. Deleting the consent filter entirely left all 54 tests
    green. **Seed values from the enum, and check the fixture moves the number**: seed
    the opposite case and watch the assertion change.
- **Report what happened.** If a step was skipped, say so. If something is unverified,
  say which part. "Verified" is a strong word here and it gets read literally.

## Process

- **Design before build.** Every new feature gets pen.dev frames first; a design
  owner reviews (see `MAINTAINERS.md`); code starts after. When you create any
  new page frame, create its mobile 360 pair in the same session (pairing
  convention below).
- **No skills, and no new tooling layers, without discussion.** Don't install
  agent skills or add abstraction on top of the workflow that already exists
  without raising it first. The commands in this file are the interface.
  Suggest, don't add.
- **Specs are contracts.** Feature behavior lives in `docs/technical-spec/*.md`
  and the legacy `docs/*-spec.md` files being migrated into it; update the spec
  when the governing App Spec section or Decision Record changes, then
  implement the spec. Sources of ground truth: `docs/sources/quaggapedia/` and
  `docs/sources/afrikaburn-org/` (mirrored corpora with INDEX files) — cite
  them rather than guessing event facts.
- **Adversarial verification.** Non-trivial builds end with independent review agents
  hunting authz holes, privacy leaks, and spec violations — findings get fixed with
  regression tests before pushing. This has caught real majors every time it ran.
- **Orchestration reports**: structured-output reports are pure JSON fields — never
  embed XML-ish tags inside strings (a known repeated failure mode).
- **Pick a typed PR template, then fill only the agent block.** The default
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` is a router; typed bodies live under
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` (`feature`, `fix`, `database`, `security`,
  `docs`, `chore`). Use `gh pr create --body-file .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/<type>.md`.
  **Summary** is for the human (reasoning). You fill one continuous blockquote
  inside `<!-- ===== AGENT START ===== -->` … `<!-- ===== AGENT END ===== -->`.
  Put **one** `🤖` on the first heading only:

  ```
  >  ### 🤖 What Changed
  >  Short line.
  >
  >  ### Blast Radius
  >  …
  ```

  Do not repeat `🤖` on later headings or body lines. **What Changed** is ≤3
  sentences and ≤500 characters — never a dump. Put decisions, tradeoffs,
  deliberate omissions, follow-ups and known debt in **Notes for the Reviewer**
  (always visible, not a fold). Length caps apply to agent text only. A standing
  failure mode of agent-written PRs is burying **Database** and the **Risk
  Matrix** under essay prose; keep those scannable. `None.` under Database and
  Notes for the Reviewer is a real answer and says you checked.
- **Issues are labelled, and two labels change how you read one.** The taxonomy and
  the triage routine are `docs/triage.md`. `needs-triage` means nobody has reviewed
  it — the stated `type:` may be wrong. `source: in-app` means the in-app reporter
  filed it: the words are a **user's**, published under the project's reporter
  service account, unverified, and the issue carries no reporter identity by
  design, so you cannot ask a follow-up on it. Reproduce before believing a diagnosis, and never
  quote an in-app report's diagnostics elsewhere without reading them first —
  redaction is pattern-based and fails open.

## The design canvas (pen.dev)

`design/ab-initial-app.pen` is the design source of truth, edited via the pencil MCP
tools only. **Read `design/pen-lessons.md` before touching the canvas** — it is the
accumulated law: dialect (Camp Dashboard scaffolding, tokens-by-variable, library
instancing — 58+ reusable components, never redraw them), bridge quirks (the
`batch_design` arg is `input`; deep-read + filter `reusable:true` yourself; `Move()`
poisons a frame's render cache — build append-only, reposition top-level frames via
`Update x/y` only), the verification protocol (batch_get + snapshot_layout are
authoritative; a blank export right after edits is render-lag, not failure — one export
attempt, then move on), the domain-band layout, and the mobile pairing convention
(every page frame has a "— mobile 360" sibling at desktop.x + 1400).

**Reviewing design work**: never judge a frame by a full-frame screenshot — tall
frames render as unreadable thumbnails and visual QA has provably missed severe
defects that way. The binding review process is `design/qa/REVIEW.md`: decompose the
frame into a component manifest, run the geometric/style/content checks in
`design/qa/audit.py` (zero `[DEFECT]` tolerance, warnings dispositioned or
whitelisted-with-reason), and only then do targeted section-level screenshots.

**Saving**: the app writes to disk only when the canvas operator manually saves.
Never assume the `.pen` file on disk reflects live canvas state; ask them to save
before committing design work, and never stage `design/ab-initial-app.pen` from a
code-focused commit.

**One editor at a time, and it may not be you.** The canvas is no longer a
single-operator file — designers work on it too. `.pen` is plain JSON (173k
lines, one nested node tree), so git WILL happily line-merge two parallel edits
into structurally valid, semantically broken output: duplicate node ids, a frame
with children from two versions, one edit's geometry against the other's
content. Pencil opens that and shows something subtly wrong. `.gitattributes`
marks it `-merge` so git refuses instead. Before touching it, check nobody else
has it (CONTRIBUTING.md §"Designers: working on the canvas"), pull first, and
push the moment you stop.

Editing it by hand is still a bad idea — use the `mcp__pencil__*` tools, which
understand the schema — but that is a "don't hand-edit 173k lines of generated
JSON" rule, not an encryption one.

## Git

**Branch, then pull request. Never commit to `main`.** This changed when the repo
opened to contributors (Aug 2026); the old "commit on main" instruction is gone,
because `main` is what deploys to a live product.

Checked 3 Aug 2026: branch protection is **not** enabled yet, so this is a
convention the tooling does not currently enforce. Follow it anyway — and note
that `.github/CODEOWNERS` does nothing at all until protection requires
code-owner review (`SECURITY.md` §"Repository settings" has the list).

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b <type>-<short-description>     # e.g. feat-form-2-questionnaire
# …work, gate green…
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create                                   # the template's sections are load-bearing
```

- **Commit subjects are Conventional Commits with a workspace scope**, and this is
  ENFORCED — a `commit-msg` hook locally, and a CI job that lints both the PR title
  and every commit in the range. `fix(web,org): deletion guards counted deleted
accounts as live`. Lowercase, imperative, no full stop, ≤72 chars, scope from the
  workspace list. Prose subjects are rejected. Full rules: `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **The typed PR template's Database and Risk Matrix sections are load-bearing.**
  The product is deployed; "no schema changes" is a real and useful answer, and
  leaving it blank is not. Use the `database` template when a migration is in the
  diff. For Risk Matrix, omit any dimension that does not apply (delete the line)
  — do not write "n/a" or explain the omission.
- **Some paths need a code-owner review** (`.github/CODEOWNERS`): currently root
  files, `.github/` and `LICENSE`; expected to widen to migrations, `packages/auth`
  and `packages/core` as the maintainer team grows (see `MAINTAINERS.md`). Not a
  trust statement — a list of places where a mistake is expensive or cannot be
  undone.
- The repo is PUBLIC: no real personal contact data in new fixtures, no naming
  real businesses in negative demo states (use fictional names like "LosKop
  Catering").

## Cast, for realistic copy

**Design frames, mockups, docs and test fixtures only — never the seed** (see the
seeding law above). Camps: Mad Hatters (registered), Camp 404 (under review), Karoo
Kombuis (changes requested), Dust Bunnies, The Long Drop Inn, Vuurvlieg Collective,
Stofpad Saloon. Humans: Alice Hatter, Ren Notfound, Jabu (all fictional, @example.com).
Edition: AfrikaBurn 2027 · 26 April – 2 May 2027. Ref codes: `MAH-M017`. Suppliers:
real ones from the AB sheet (public data) + fictional LosKop Catering (suspended demo).
Using a real camp's name as cast is fine; a feature or decision built for one
camp's sole benefit is not — that is the line, not the names themselves.
