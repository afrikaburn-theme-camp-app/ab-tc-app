# AfrikaBurn Theme Camp App (Quagga Portal)

**_Quagga Portal_** — one place where a burner has an account, a camp has a
profile, a camp registers for an edition, and AfrikaBurn staff review what comes
in. It replaces a patchwork of Google Forms, WhatsApp threads and spreadsheets.

## Three apps, one account

Sign in once; the same identity works across all three.

### 🏕️ Participant

**Deployment URL:** set per environment (see `docs/deploy.md`).

For burners. Your profile, your camp, invites, and the six-section registration
that gets a camp placed.

### 🎛️ Organiser console

**Deployment URL:** set per environment (see `docs/deploy.md`).

For AfrikaBurn staff. The review queue, questionnaires, bulletins, suppliers,
the audit trail and the system panel.

### 📦 Supplier portal

**Deployment URL:** set per environment (see `docs/deploy.md`).

For the companies camps hire. Sign-up, onboarding steps, documents, and
standing.

> ⚠️ **The deployment is live**, with real participants' phone numbers,
> emergency contacts and medical notes in it. Run it locally; never test against
> those URLs. [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) explains why — it is the one rule with
> no exceptions.

## Quick start

Needs **Node ≥ 22**, **pnpm 10**, and **Docker** for the local database.

```bash
pnpm install

# Postgres 16 + the two Neon proxies the drivers need (HTTP and WebSocket)
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

# Migrate, then seed reference data (no accounts — see below)
pnpm --filter @quagga/db db:migrate:deploy
pnpm --filter @quagga/db db:seed

# All three apps, or one: pnpm dev --filter @quagga/web
pnpm dev
```

```bash
# .env — copy from .env.example
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/quagga
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/quagga
NEON_LOCAL_PROXY=1
```

Three things that will otherwise stop you:

- **All three apps boot with no env at all**, to a graceful "not configured"
  state. That is a rule, not a convenience.
- **There are no seeded accounts, in any environment.** Sign up through the app
  like a real person. An empty directory on a fresh database is correct.
- **Reaching the org console locally takes one extra step.** `god` is granted
  only to a _verified_ `GOD_EMAILS` address, and nothing verifies email locally
  — flip the flag by hand, recipe in [`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md).

### The two gates

```bash
pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build   # the fast gate — never runs a browser
pnpm e2e:local                             # the other gate — 8 personas, from cold
pnpm e2e:local specs/new-burner            # ...or just one
pnpm test:coverage                         # coverage floors — all 8 workspaces
```

## Stack

| Layer        | What we use                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Apps**     | Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · Tailwind v4 · shadcn/ui             |
| **Data**     | Neon Postgres · Drizzle ORM · append-only SQL migrations                 |
| **Auth**     | Self-hosted Better Auth 1.6.25 — password, Google, TOTP 2FA, passkeys    |
| **Tooling**  | Turborepo · pnpm workspaces · TypeScript strict · Zod at every boundary  |
| **Testing**  | Vitest (unit) · Playwright (8 persona suites) · v8 coverage floors       |
| **Services** | Resend (email) · Vercel Blob (uploads) · GitHub Issues (in-app reporter) |

Shared packages under `@quagga/`:

```
packages/core     domain logic + every authz predicate — the security boundary
packages/db       Drizzle schema, migrations, and the deploy migrator
packages/auth     Better Auth config, mounted by all three apps
packages/ui       shadcn components and the Tailwind token layer
packages/types    Zod schemas and shared types
```

**`@quagga/core` never imports `@quagga/db`.** The rules stay pure and testable;
apps ask the predicate, never re-implement it. A hidden button and a refused
action cannot disagree.

naming real businesses in negative demo states.

## Contributing

You do not need to be a backend engineer — most of the work is front-end, design
and wording. **Start with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).** This project
follows a [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); see
[`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md) for how decisions get made and
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md) for who currently maintains it.

| Report a **security or privacy** problem        | **Privately** — [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Never a public issue.          |
| Write some code                                 | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), then pick up an issue and say so on it |

Two rules that catch people out:

- **Nothing may claim something that isn't true.** A disabled control says why;
  a "saved" message means something was saved. It is the most common reason a
  change gets sent back.
- **Personal data has classes**, enforced in `@quagga/core` and never in the UI.
  Some fields can never be public; medical notes are visible only to that
  burner's own camp leads and safety staff, and every read is audited. See
  [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) §Privacy classes.

## Documentation

The product's source of truth is the **App Specification** — an external,
Requirement-ID-tagged document (Superhuman, mirrored to a Coda change record).
**[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#direction-of-information-travel) carries
the link** and is also the full index and rulebook for everything under
`docs/`: every doc's category and Requirement-ID coverage, the language/status
conventions every doc follows, and the protocol for updating this repo's docs
when the App Spec changes. Start there.

[`docs/sources/`](docs/sources/) holds **verbatim primary sources — never
edit**: AfrikaBurn's own published pages and the original scope documents.

**Design** lives in `design/ab-initial-app.pen`, edited only through the Pencil
MCP tools. Read [`design/pen-lessons.md`](design/pen-lessons.md) before touching
the canvas and [`design/qa/REVIEW.md`](design/qa/REVIEW.md) before reviewing a
frame.

on it; don't ship a competing product from it in the meantime. Each version
converts to Apache 2.0 on the second anniversary of the date it was made
