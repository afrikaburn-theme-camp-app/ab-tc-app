// Self-hosted Better Auth mounted in-process for this app (docs/technical-spec/01-auth-and-identity.md
// §2.1). The shared @quagga/auth config points its drizzleAdapter at our own
// Neon DB, so this handler serves the full auth surface — sign-in/up, session,
// OAuth callbacks, password reset, verification, sign-out — at /api/auth/*.
//
// Env-less boot (AGENTS.md rule 4): @quagga/auth constructs with a build
// placeholder secret, so this import never throws; requests only mint real,
// cross-app-valid sessions once BETTER_AUTH_SECRET is set on all three projects.
