// The deletion sweeper (docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §Deletion). Finds every
// deletion request whose 14-day grace period has elapsed and SANITIZES the
// account — anonymize to a "Departed Burner" stub, preserving memberships,
// questionnaire responses and audit history.
//
// WHY A ROUTE AND NOT A BUILD STEP OR BOOT HOOK. This is the most destructive
// operation in the system. It must be triggered deliberately, by a scheduler or
// an operator, never as a side effect of deploying — the same discipline that
// keeps migrations out of the build (AGENTS.md §Hard engineering rules 1).
//
// AUTHORISATION. Requires `ACCOUNT_SWEEP_SECRET` as a bearer token. When the
// secret is UNSET the route refuses to do anything and says so: an unauthenticated
// endpoint that erases accounts is not a thing that should exist even briefly, and
// failing closed here costs nothing (nothing is erased until someone configures
// it). This keeps the env-less boot rule intact — the route exists, responds, and
// declines.
//
// HOW IT IS TRIGGERED. A Vercel Cron entry (apps/web/vercel.json) hits this path
// daily. Vercel Cron can only issue GET requests and authenticates them by
// injecting `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (only when CRON_SECRET is set).
// So a GET that carries a bearer matching CRON_SECRET *or* ACCOUNT_SWEEP_SECRET
// runs the sweep; every other GET stays status-only and erases nothing. POST is
// unchanged (operator/manual trigger with the ACCOUNT_SWEEP_SECRET bearer). The
// refusal behaviour is intact end-to-end: no configured secret ⇒ no sweep, and an
// unauthenticated caller (GET or POST) never erases anything.
