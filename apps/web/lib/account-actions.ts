/**
 * Revoke a change from the OLD address's link, inside the 48h window. Available
 * to an UNAUTHENTICATED caller on purpose: the whole point is that someone who
 * has lost control of their account can pull the change back from their email.
 *
 * THIS IS THE MIRROR OF `confirmEmailChange`, AND IT HAS TO BE.
 *
 * It was not. It flipped the request row to `revoked`, wrote the security event,
 * and told the reader "Reversed. Your sign-in email is back to what it was."
 * while `user.email` — the actual sign-in identity, which `confirmEmailChange`
 * had already moved — still held the NEW address. Picture what that is for:
 * someone's session is stolen, the thief points the account at their own inbox
 * and confirms it, and the 48-hour revocation email is the victim's one lever.
 * They pulled it, read a sentence saying they had their account back, and were
 * still locked out. A revocation that only revokes the paperwork is worse than
 * no revocation at all, because it stops the person looking for real help.
 *
 * So the undo now does what confirm did, backwards, in one transaction:
 *  - the request row moves out of its current state (a compare-and-set, so two
 *    clicks of the same emailed link cannot restore twice);
 *  - `user.email` and `users.email` go back to `currentEmail`;
 *  - if any of it fails, ALL of it fails and nothing is announced.
 * Success is only ever claimed for a transaction that committed.
