// The sanitization runner — the business end of account deletion
// (docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §Deletion, the Camp 404 "Lost Cat" precedent).
//
// This is the ONLY place application rows are erased, and it never deletes our
// own `users` row (it survives as the "Departed Burner" stub). It DOES hard-delete
// the Better Auth IDENTITY (user/account/session) — that is the POPIA erasure.
// @quagga/core `buildSanitizationPlan` decides WHAT to erase; this module applies
// it, and records that it happened.
//
// ATOMICITY: every erasure write runs inside ONE pooled transaction, so a
// partial POPIA erasure is impossible — either the identity + bios + secrets are
// all gone and the tombstone is stamped, or nothing changed and the request
// stays `pending` for the next sweep. ORDERING still matters WITHIN the
// transaction (foreign keys, and the tombstone-last invariant):
//   1. capture the address to notify + the auth_user_id BEFORE the transaction
//      (after the erasure the email is gone; the auth_user_id is needed to delete
//      the identity);
//   2. purge the secrets/context tables (profile keys, in-flight email-change
//      tokens, security events);
//   3. patch every `burner_bios` row for the account;
//   4. HARD-DELETE the Better Auth identity — sessions, then credential/OAuth
//      accounts, then the user row (email PII). This signs the account out
//      everywhere and destroys the password hash, so a "deleted" account can
//      neither sign in with its password nor ride a lingering cookie;
//   5. patch the `users` row LAST — `sanitized_at` is the tombstone, committed in
//      the same transaction as the erasure it attests to. `auth_user_id` is left
//      unchanged so the tombstone stays findable by the session resolvers. A
//      crash mid-way rolls the whole transaction back, leaving the request
//      `pending`; the sweep simply runs again (every step is also idempotent, so
//      a re-run is harmless).
//
// Note what is NOT here: no delete of memberships, questionnaire responses,
// required actions, supplier acks, or audit events. Preserving those is the
// entire point — the cascade would be the damage.
//
// What IS here, since 31 Jul 2026: the three things this account was holding ON
// BEHALF OF OTHERS are released — a claimed supplier listing, any wrangler
// assignment, and console access. Each of those foreign keys is declared
// `ON DELETE SET NULL` in the schema precisely so losing a person leaves the
// thing VACANT rather than broken, and NONE of them could ever fire, because
// keeping the `users` row is the whole design. The cascade the schema was
// relying on had to be written out by hand.

  //      sweeper erases both. Zero live System managers, and no screen can grant
  //      `god` back — the console deliberately forbids it, so the way back is an
