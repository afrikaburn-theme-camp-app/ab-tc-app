// OWN Better Auth in-process, so the server API `auth.api.*` exposes the full
// surface — session listing/revocation, password change/reset, email
// verification, linked-account listing, change-email, unlink and delete-user are
// all real server calls. 2FA/TOTP, backup codes and passkeys remain unavailable
// only because their PLUGINS are not yet installed (a scheduled task), not
// because a provider forbids them. `AUTH_CAPABILITIES` in @quagga/core is the
// authority; the /account/security surface reads it and renders an honest
// unavailable state rather than a control that does nothing.
//
// The self-hosted server API takes `{ headers }` and RETURNS data directly
// (throwing on failure), unlike the old client-shaped `{ data, error }`. Every
// read here degrades gracefully: env-less or an error returns an empty/unknown
// state, never a throw, so the account pages still render.
