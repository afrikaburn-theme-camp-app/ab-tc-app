// The honest "we can't do this yet" block — @quagga/core's capability matrix
// resolved into the shared presentation (roadmap M4-21).
//
// THE RULE (docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §"Capability matrix"): a
// surface for a capability our auth server does not expose must say so plainly
// and offer NO control that pretends otherwise. Every word comes from
// `AUTH_CAPABILITIES` — the single machine-readable authority — so the day a
// capability flips to `supported`, the notice disappears from every surface at
// once and nobody has to hunt for stale copy.
//
// The wording now lives in core's `capabilityVerdict` rather than here, because
// the org console and the supplier portal render the same refusal and a second
// copy of "Not finished yet" is a second copy that can drift.
