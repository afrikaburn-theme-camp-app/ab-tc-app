/**
 * Staff-assigned camp code + erf (roadmap R1).
 *
 * NOT A PLACEMENT TOOL, and the copy says so rather than implying a map exists.
 * The erf is whatever AfrikaBurn's placement process decides it is — a free-text
 * label typed by the person who made the decision — because no structured erf
 * data exists to validate against (Requirements §13 is blocked on AB's mapping
 * process).
 *
 * DISABLED AND EXPLAINED rather than hidden when the viewer lacks the
 * capability — but the CAPABILITY SENTENCE ITSELF IS NOT REPEATED HERE.
 *
 * This panel takes a boolean, not the refusal prose, and that is deliberate. The
 * rail already prints the department refusal once, in whichever card is showing
 * it: the Decision card while the registration is undecided, the Wrangler card
 * once it is approved. Passing the same paragraph into every card is how a rail
 * becomes something nobody reads — `assign-wrangler.tsx` and `suppliers-table.tsx`
 * both say so ("the reason is stated ONCE"), and a strict-mode e2e assertion
 * caught the third copy before a person had to.
