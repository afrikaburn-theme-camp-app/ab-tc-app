//
// THE RULE (docs/technical-spec/12-suppliers.md §"Binding rule", enforced in
// `validateDocumentBinding` and re-checked at apply time in
// `applyDocumentAcksToSteps`): a document may only bind to a step the SUPPLIER
// completes themselves. Org-confirmed steps (deposit, briefing, registration
// fee) and org-reviewed steps are excluded — a supplier ticking a checkbox must
// never be able to confirm that money arrived or that they attended a briefing.
// Filtering the picker is a courtesy, not the boundary: the action rejects a
// forged step key regardless.
