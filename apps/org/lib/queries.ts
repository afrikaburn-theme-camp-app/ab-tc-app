// Data access for the console. Every function is read-only and self-contained;
// mutations live in lib/actions/*. All assume the caller already cleared the
// gate (resolveOrgSession) — these do not re-check auth.
//
// EXCEPT for one thing, which they DO decide here: PERSONAL INFORMATION.
//
// Every query that returns a person takes the caller's `OrgActor` and resolves
// `seesPersonalInformation` BEFORE the select — the `canViewMedicalNotes`
// pattern (see `getRosterMemberDetail`), applied to the rest of it. A refused
// caller does not merely fail to see a contact number: the column is never
// selected, so it is never in the row, never in the returned object, and never
// in the RSC payload a component would have shipped it in regardless of what it
// rendered.
//
// Deciding after the fetch is the shape this deliberately avoids. A value that
// reached render scope is one careless `<pre>{JSON.stringify(detail)}</pre>`, one
// `console.log`, one new prop away from shipping — and none of those look like a
// privacy bug in review.
//
// SINCE 27 JUL 2026 THE ANSWER IS PER DOMAIN, NOT PER ACTOR. Ryan: "supplier
// leads would be able to read the PII of anything supply-related" — so a
// Suppliers lead reads supplier notes' authors and must be refused a theme
// camp's members. Every call therefore NAMES THE PART OF THE CONSOLE it is
// serving, and the predicate resolves the department that owns that part
// (@quagga/core `org-domains`). There is deliberately no un-domained version
// available here: the domain argument is the enforcement, and a default would be
// the leak.

/**
 * Whether the caller receives personal information ON THIS PART OF THE CONSOLE.
 *
 * `domain` is required and is the whole point. An org-wide role passes for every
 * domain; a department-scoped one passes only for the domains its department
 * owns; a domain nobody owns is reachable by org-wide roles alone.

// manager does, which is the correct answer for a scheduling surface.

 *
 * BUT THEY MUST HAVE A USERNAME. An org account with no Burner Bio has no
 * display name — `publicMemberName(null)` is the literal string "Unnamed
 * burner" — so without this filter the picker is a list of identical entries
 * and the camp is told "Unnamed burner is now your wrangler". The only other
 * identifier on the row is the email, and putting that in a scheduling control
 * would make the list's CONTENTS depend on who is looking (`personal_information`
 * is department-scoped), so two reviewers would see different rosters.
