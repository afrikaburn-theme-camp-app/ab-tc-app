// What this deployment is ACTUALLY configured with — derived, never asserted.
//
// This is the module behind `/system`. It exists because "the app is broken" is
// almost never a code question: it is email verification silently off because
// nobody set a Resend key, uploads falling back to link-paste because the blob
// token is missing, a migration that would refuse to run against a pooled
// endpoint, or a database that is simply not there. Every one of those states
// already exists in this codebase and already degrades honestly — but each one
// is honest in its OWN corner, so the person debugging has to know where to
// look. This puts them on one page.
//
// THREE RULES, in order of how badly they would hurt if broken:
//
//  1. NEVER PRINT A SECRET. Every check reports whether a value is SET and what
//     follows from that — never the value. The one deliberate exception is a
//     database HOSTNAME (parsed out with `connectionHost`, so a password in the
//     connection string cannot come with it), because "which database am I
//     actually talking to" is the question this page exists to answer and a host
//     is not a credential. `redactSecrets` is the backstop for anything that
//     arrives from outside — a driver error can and does quote the connection
//     string it failed on — and a unit test seeds every secret env var with a
//     marker and asserts no marker survives into any rendered string.
//  2. DERIVE, DO NOT DUPLICATE. Email verification, the rate-limit ceiling,
//     passkey scoping and the session lifetime all come from @quagga/auth's own
//     pure resolvers; the migration verdict comes from @quagga/db's `planMigration`,
//     the same function the build calls. A page that reported its own second
//     opinion of the config would be worse than no page, because it would be
//     believed. If this file ever computes a policy itself, that is the bug.
//  3. SAY WHY, NOT JUST WHAT. "Email verification: off" invites someone to go
//     turn it on and find no switch. "Off — impossible without an email sender;
//     it switches on the moment RESEND_API_KEY exists" ends the investigation.
//
// PURE. No `server-only`, no `process.env`, no database — it takes an env bag
// and a probe result and returns a report, so the whole thing is unit-tested
// (`__tests__/system-status.test.ts`). `system-probe.ts` is the server half that
// reads the real env and runs the real probe.
