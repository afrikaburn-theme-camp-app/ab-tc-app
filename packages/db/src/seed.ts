/**
 * Idempotent seed script (build-spec §Seeds).
 *
 * ## The seeding principle (Ryan, 26 Jul 2026 — binding)
 *
 * **Seeds contain ONLY org-owned reference/catalog data. Every burner, camp,
 * membership, registration and questionnaire response — in EVERY environment,
 * including the kickoff demo — is created live through the app.**
 *
 * There are no seeded accounts and no seeded user-generated content. The demo
 * is performed live: Ryan signs up as a real burner, registers Camp 404 through
 * the actual wizard, and the org side reviews it. That is more honest (it shows
 * the real journey) and it removes an entire class of seed/auth-identity drift —
 * seeded users previously carried placeholder `authUserId = seed:<email>`
 * strings and could never sign in, which made every "sign in as a seeded owner"
 * step of every smoke test un-performable.
 *
 * ### Seeded (org-owned reference/catalog data)
 *   - edition AfrikaBurn 2027 (2027-04-26 → 2027-05-02, active)
 *   - the org group "AfrikaBurn" itself (no memberships — staff elevate live via
 *     GOD_EMAILS — the kickoff demo beat)
 *   - the two seeded ORG ROLES (Org staff, Engineer) carrying the rights those
 *     ranks held before they became data. Insert-if-missing, so a System
 *     manager's own edits to them survive every later deploy. No departments and
 *     no role ASSIGNMENTS are seeded — those are live acts.
 *   - the 8 canonical camp categories for the edition (org taxonomy; the org may
 *     edit freely afterwards)
 *   - the supplier repository imported from data/suppliers.json (the scrubbed AB
 *     public sheet snapshot) + each supplier's per-edition onboarding step map.
 *     This is a CATALOG camps pick from, not user content. Suppliers seed with
 *     `userId = null` on purpose, so a real supplier can later self-register and
 *     claim their row by email overlap (docs/technical-spec/12-suppliers.md).
 *   - one org-authored questionnaire TEMPLATE (definition only — no activation,
 *     no audience, no responses), so the console has a real form to send live.
 *
 * ### Never seeded
 *   - users, burner bios, theme camps / artworks / mutant vehicles, memberships,
 *     invites, registrations, supplier declarations, section reviews,
 *     questionnaire activations / required actions / responses, notifications,
 *     bulletins, audit events, supplier notes. All of it is live-created.
 *   - payments: AfrikaBurn never receives payment from theme camps —
 *     registration is free. The `payments` table stays frozen in the schema for
 *     future logistics apps, but nothing is ever seeded against registrations.
 *
 * Safe to run repeatedly: every write is keyed on the row's real unique
 * constraint (or, where none exists, a find-then-write lookup).
 *
 * BOOTSTRAP, NOT SYNC — and "safe to run repeatedly" means the SECOND run
 * changes nothing, not merely that it does not crash. Anything the org can edit
 * in the console (a supplier's standing, its onboarding progress, which domains
 * a department owns) is INSERT-IF-MISSING here. A seed that re-asserts the
 * committed snapshot reverts real decisions on a schedule, silently, and the
 * deploy that did it logs nothing an organiser would ever see.
 *
 * Run via `pnpm --filter @quagga/db db:seed` once `DATABASE_URL` is set. This
 * script is NEVER part of any build step and must not run at import time.
