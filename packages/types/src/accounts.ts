// IMPORTANT CONTEXT — what the identity provider actually gives us. We run
// SELF-HOSTED Better Auth (@quagga/auth, better-auth 1.6.25), mounted in-process
// in each app against our own Neon DB. Self-hosting lets us install Better Auth
// server plugins, so the full surface — including TOTP two-factor + encrypted
// backup codes (twoFactor plugin) and WebAuthn passkeys (@better-auth/passkey),
// both landed in migration 0015 — is now real. The capability matrix is the
// machine-readable record of what actually ships — see `AUTH_CAPABILITIES` in
// @quagga/core for the authority, and `docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md` for the
// narrative. Nothing in this file assumes a capability the stack does not expose.
//
// Keep every enum here in sync with the matching pgEnum in @quagga/db schema.ts.
