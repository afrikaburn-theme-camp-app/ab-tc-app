/**
 * Membership role ladder, recorded on `memberships.role` (one row per
 * user × group). Roles are scoped to a group — a burner can hold `member` on
 * one camp and `lead` on another, and an org rank on the single seeded
 * AfrikaBurn org group.
 *
 * - `god`       — the highest org rank, PRESENTED EVERYWHERE AS "System
 *                 manager" (see below); ONLY valid on the org group.
 *                 Bootstrapped from the `GOD_EMAILS` env list on first login.
 * - `org_staff` — an AfrikaBurn org account (org group only).
 * - `engineer`  — an AfrikaBurn org account created through the IT path (org
 *                 group only).
 * - `lead`      — a project's leader; can manage invites + registration.
 * - `admin`     — a project co-organiser below the lead.
 * - `member`    — a plain member of a group.
 *
 * **ON THE ORG GROUP, THIS ENUM IS THE DOOR — NOT THE RIGHTS.** Since org roles
 * v1 (migration 0018) `org_staff` and `engineer` mean exactly one thing: *this
 * account may load the console*. WHAT they may then read and do comes from the
 * ORG ROLES they hold (`org_roles` + `org_role_assignments`), which a System
 * manager creates, edits and assigns — see @quagga/core `org-permissions`
 * (`orgCan`) and `org-roles`. `god` is the one exception and the anti-lockout
 * anchor: a god IS the System manager and resolves every capability whatever any
 * role row says, so no edit to a table can define the System manager out of
 * existence.
 *
 * **`god` IS "System manager" — do not "fix" this.** The rank Ryan calls the
 * System manager is STORED as `god` on purpose. Renaming the enum value would
 * mean migrating every live row, re-cutting the GOD_EMAILS bootstrap (which
 * writes the literal `god`), and touching every god-persona e2e spec — all for
 * a label. So the storage keeps `god` and the UI reads
 * `ORG_RANK_LABELS` (@quagga/core `org-permissions`), which maps
 * `god → "System manager"`. If you came here to make the names agree: the
 * inconsistency is deliberate, and the label layer is the place to change.
 *
 * Keep this tuple in sync with `membershipRoleEnum` in @quagga/db schema.ts —
 * the database is the storage authority; this is the validation authority.
 * Both are APPEND-ONLY (a Postgres enum value cannot be reordered or removed
 * without rewriting the type), which is why `engineer` sits at the end rather
 * than in rank order.

// The org side of the SAME idea the camp side already solved in Roles v2 below:
// a role row carries a key, a label, a KIND that encodes permanence, and a
// `permissions` JSONB object. One vocabulary, two scopes — read `ProjectRoleKind`
// / `UNDELETABLE_ROLE_KINDS` further down and the shapes will look familiar,
// because they are deliberately the same shapes.
//
// Ryan, 27 Jul 2026: "system admins can simply have a roles management section
// and create n sign these things instead of needing to hardcode them? With some
// set permanent ones, like team leads and team members for each department
// domain, these cant be removed but they can have the rights edited."

/**
 * An org role's kind — permanence, exactly as `ProjectRoleKind` does it:
 *
 * - `system` — SEEDED and UNDELETABLE, rights EDITABLE. Ryan's "set permanent
 *   ones": the two migrated ranks (Org staff, Engineer) and the LEAD + MEMBER
 *   pair every department gets when a System manager creates it. A department's
 *   two roles live and die with the department (FK cascade).
 * - `custom` — a System manager creates, renames, re-scopes, re-rights and
 *   deletes these freely.
 *
 * Only `custom` may be deleted. BOTH may be renamed and BOTH may have their
 * permissions edited — "cannot be removed" is not "cannot be changed", and the
 * editable rights are the whole point of the change.

/**
 * CRUD PLUS PERSONAL INFORMATION. Five keys, and a feature asks for one of them

 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED, and why (Ryan, 28 Jul 2026: "There should just be CRUD
 * operations per department, not scope to individual actions"). The vocabulary
 * was `read · read_personal_information · write · delete ·
 * manage_camp_categories · manage_accounts · read_system`, and it had drifted
 * into per-feature rights:
 *
 *   · `manage_camp_categories` existed for ONE screen. A right invented because
 *     a feature needed one is a right every future feature will invent again;
 *     it is now ordinary CRUD on the `camp_categories` domain.
 *   · `manage_accounts` and `read_system` were never departmental at all — they
 *     are "do you run this deployment", which is the System manager rank. They
 *     are gone as grants; `isSystemManager` is the check.
 *   · `write` conflated CREATE and UPDATE across 19 actions, so a role that
 *     could amend a supplier's standing could also add suppliers. Split.
 *   · `delete` was department-scoped but wired to exactly TWO actions, both
 *     supplier ones — so every department's rights screen described deleting
 *     suppliers, whatever the department was. Now it means delete IN THE
 *     DOMAIN the department owns, which is the thing the checkbox always
 *     claimed to say.
 *
 * `personal_information` stays its own key rather than folding into `read`
 * (Ryan, 28 Jul 2026: "PII should be a specific permission scoped to the
 * relevant department or context"). Reading a supplier's onboarding state and
 * reading a burner's medical notes are different acts, and POPIA treats them
 * differently; one checkbox for both would make every reader of a list a reader
 * of health data.
 *
 * NOT APPEND-ONLY ANY MORE — migration 0022 rewrites every stored row into this
 * vocabulary, so no `org_roles.permissions` object names a retired key. The
 * reader still ignores unknown keys, which is what makes that migration safe to
 * run while the old build is still serving.
