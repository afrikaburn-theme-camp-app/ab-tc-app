// THE HOOK BODIES, ACTUALLY CALLED.
//
// deletion-hook.test.ts asserts the session-create hook EXISTS, and it is
// deliberately mock-free — so it stays that way and this file is separate.
// But "a hook function exists" is precisely the shape of the B1 regression its
// own header describes: the wiring test stayed green while the hook handed a
// Better Auth TEXT id to a uuid column, Postgres refused the comparison, the
// catch swallowed it, and every sign-in silently reported nothing to cancel.
//
// Four of config.ts's six functions are these hook bodies and none of them was
// ever executed. What ships green without this file: a re-authentication that
// cancels the very deletion it is on its way to REQUEST, and a "welcome back"
// receipt mailed to a null address.
//
// Two module boundaries are stubbed and only two: ../email (so nothing is
// sent) and @quagga/db's `cancelPendingDeletion` (so nothing needs Postgres).
// `createHttpDb` stays real — it opens no connection until a query runs, which
// is what lets buildAuthOptions be called env-less at all.
