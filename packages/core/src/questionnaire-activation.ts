// Questionnaire activation lifecycle (docs/technical-spec/10-questionnaire-engine.md §"Engine mechanics").
// An ACTIVATION = definition × edition × audience × options. Activating it
// resolves the audience (see ./audience) into `required_actions` rows keyed
// `questionnaire:<activation_id>`; submitting a response flips that row to
// completed and stamps the response's `activationId`.
//
// Pure builders only — the caller performs the inserts/updates. Keeping the
// row-shaping here makes the gate/notification loop unit-testable and keeps the
// key convention in one place.

/**
 * Resolve the definition an activation must be rendered / validated / aggregated
 * against. The SNAPSHOT taken at activation time is authoritative: it is what the
 * respondents were actually shown, so editing (or re-versioning) the live
 * definition afterwards must never change it. The `liveFallback` is used ONLY for
 * pre-snapshot activation rows (activated before the snapshot column existed,
 * where `snapshot` is null) so no backfill is required.
 *
 * Generic over the definition shape so both apps and tests can call it without a
 * @quagga/types dependency here; callers pass `Questionnaire` values.
