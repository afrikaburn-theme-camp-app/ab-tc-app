// Questionnaire authorization (docs/technical-spec/10-questionnaire-engine.md §"Guardrails" + §"Authoring
// levels"). Who may author / activate / view results at each level:
//   - ORG level (org_internal / org_outbound): org_staff or god on the org
//     group.
//   - PROJECT level: the project's own lead or admin.
//   - Results visibility NEVER crosses scope: an org author cannot see a
//     project's responses, and a project admin cannot see org responses or
//     another project's.
//
// Pure predicates over the actor's memberships — no I/O. Structural roles only
// (custom project roles are labels, not permissions).
