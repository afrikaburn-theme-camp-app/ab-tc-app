// Supplier onboarding checklist (docs/technical-spec/12-suppliers.md §"Onboarding
// checklist"). The seven steps come from the real Supplier Depot registration
// procedure (docs/sources/quaggapedia/supplier-depot.md). This module is the
// code catalog + the pure derivations over a stored step-state map:
//   - SUPPLIER_ONBOARDING_STEPS: the ordered catalog with completes/confirms
//     metadata and Quaggapedia-derived inline content;
//   - deriveOnboardingProgress: n/7 + isOnboarded;
//   - validateStepTransition / applyStepTransition: the self-service vs
//     org-confirmed rule — a supplier can NEVER flip an org-confirmed step.
//
// Pure logic only — no I/O, no DB. The store persists the `steps` jsonb map;
// this decides what a given actor is allowed to do to it.
