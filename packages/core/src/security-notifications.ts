// Security notifications & emails (docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §"Security
// notifications"). Two outputs from one set of facts:
//   - an in-app `security`-kind notification row (the existing inbox), and
//   - a Resend email body (the env-less seam in each app's lib/email.ts — it
//     delivers when RESEND_API_KEY is set and logs to the console otherwise).
//
// PURITY CONTRACT: builders only. No I/O, no env, no send. The app decides
// whether to send; this module decides what it says.
//
// PRIVACY LAW (same as ./notifications): a security message names WHAT changed
// and WHEN, never a secret and never a hard-locked private field. It carries no
// password, no token, no full session id, and no IP address beyond the coarse
// location string the provider already shows the account holder about their own
// sessions. `securityMessageLeaks` is the test-facing guard.
//
// THE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST: a notification is a statement of fact. Never emit
// a "changed" message for something that did not change. Where a provider
// capability is missing (see ./auth-capabilities), the flow fails closed and no
// notification is emitted at all — a false "your email was changed" is worse
// than no email, because it teaches the burner to ignore the real one.
