// ID / passport retention (docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §"ID document —
// lawful purpose + retention"; Ryan, 26 Jul 2026).
//
// LAWFUL PURPOSE. SA ID / passport are collected on `burner_bios` for a single
// documented purpose: ON-SITE IDENTITY VERIFICATION against the ticket at the
// gate. That purpose is SPENT once an edition's gate has closed and the event has
// ended, so the data becomes purgeable — POPIA's storage-limitation principle
// (keep personal information no longer than necessary for the purpose).
//
// PURITY CONTRACT (as with the rest of @quagga/core): no I/O, no env, no DB, no
// crypto. This module owns the RULE — which editions' ID data has aged out, and
// what a purge patch looks like — so a scheduled purge job (a LATER task) has one
// tested implementation to apply. Nothing here reads or writes the database; the
// job supplies rows and applies the returned patch.
