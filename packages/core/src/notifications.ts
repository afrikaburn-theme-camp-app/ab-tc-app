// Notifications & bulletins domain logic (docs/technical-spec/11-bulletins-and-notifications.md).
//
// PURITY CONTRACT (same as the rest of @quagga/core): no I/O, no env, no DB.
// These builders turn already-safe event facts into notification PAYLOADS, and
// the bulletin consumer fans an audience out to per-recipient rows. The DB
// insert + email send are the caller's (app) responsibility.
//
// PRIVACY LAW: a builder only ever receives + emits safe, display-level fields
// (camp names, statuses, role/officer labels, standing labels, bulletin titles).
// It NEVER takes or echoes an always-private field (phone, emergency
// contacts, SA ID / passport, medical). `notificationMentionsAny` is the
// test-facing guard that proves a payload leaks none of a forbidden value set.
//
// AUDIENCE: bulletins reuse the questionnaire resolver verbatim — one resolver
// (`resolveAudience`), two consumers (questionnaire activation + bulletins).
