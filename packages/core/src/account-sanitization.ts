// Account sanitization — the Camp 404 "Lost Cat" precedent.
//
// docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §Deletion: deleting an account is NEVER a row
// delete. After the 14-day grace period we ERASE the person and KEEP the shape:
// every personal field is nulled or replaced with a stub, while `memberships`,
// `questionnaire_responses`, `required_actions`, `supplier_document_acks` and
// `audit_events` keep pointing at a row that still exists. POPIA erasure is
// satisfied (no personal information remains) without shredding a camp's roster,
// an edition's response set, or the audit trail that proves who did what.
//
// Why not `ON DELETE CASCADE`? Because the cascade is exactly the damage: a
// burner leaving would silently delete their camp's membership history, their
// answers to a questionnaire the org is still analysing, and the audit events
// recording approvals they made as a lead. Referential integrity is a safety
// property here, not a database nicety.
//
// This module is PURE: it computes the patches to apply. The app performs the
// writes. Keeping it pure is what lets the tests prove — without a database —
// that no personal field survives and no foreign key is touched.

/**
 * Patch applied to the `users` row. The row itself SURVIVES — only its personal
 * content goes: `email` and `username` are nulled and `sanitizedAt` is stamped
 * (the tombstone the guards read).
 *
 * `username` is personal data — a self-chosen handle that people recognise
 * offline — so POPIA erasure takes it, and nulling it also FREES it for someone
 * else (the unique index treats NULLs as distinct). It is not replaced with a
 * stub: the stub would have to be unique per departed account, and a username
 * has a format. The stub is a RENDER concern instead — `publicMemberName` reads
 * the tombstone and shows "Departed Burner", so a roster keeps saying what
 * happened without the departed account still holding a handle.
 *
 * `authUserId` is DELIBERATELY LEFT UNCHANGED. It is the key the session
 * resolvers look the row up by (`ensureCampUser` / `resolveOrgSession` /
 * `resolveSupplierSession` all query `where authUserId = <Better Auth user id>`),
 * so the tombstone MUST stay findable by that id or the guard can never fire:
 * an earlier design rewrote it to `deleted:<uuid>`, which meant a returning
 * session (or a session still served from the 5-minute cookie cache after the
 * Better Auth identity was deleted) looked up by the real id found NOTHING and
 * was silently minted a fresh, clean account — the "Lost Cat" re-animation hole.
 *
 * The recycled-provider-id worry that motivated the rewrite does not apply to the
 * self-hosted stack: Better Auth mints random `user.id`s and account deletion
 * hard-deletes the identity row (so the id is never reissued). Even in an
 * impossible collision, `assertNotSanitized` REFUSES the sanitized row rather
 * than adopting it — the safe failure. Keeping the original id is therefore
 * strictly safer than rewriting it, and it is what makes the guard reachable.
