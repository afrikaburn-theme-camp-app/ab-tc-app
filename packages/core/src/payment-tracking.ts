// Payment TRACKING (Requirements §8, Decision 009 — resolved 12 Aug 2026).
//
// THE PLATFORM NEVER TOUCHES MONEY, AND THIS FILE IS WHERE THAT IS ENFORCED
// RATHER THAN ASSERTED. There is no gateway, no merchant account, no card
// capture, no payout, no refund, no escrow, and no camp treasury. What exists is
// two things a spreadsheet does badly:
//
//   1. a UNIQUE CODE that identifies who a payment is for — `payments.reference`
//      (`QP-2027-MAH-001`, from ./payment-reference) for an AfrikaBurn-side fee,
//      and `memberships.ref_code` (`MAH-M017`, from ./member-ref-code) for a
//      camp reconciling its own EFTs against its own bank account;
//   2. a CHECKBOX a staff member ticks once the money has arrived somewhere
//      else — the status below.
//
// The money moves through AfrikaBurn's existing channels. We record that it did.
// Any future change here that starts accepting an amount FROM a payer, rather
// than recording one an administrator observed, is out of scope by construction
// and needs Decision 009 reopened first.
