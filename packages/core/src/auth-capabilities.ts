// What our identity provider ACTUALLY supports (the capability matrix).
//
// As of the self-hosted migration (docs/technical-spec/01-auth-and-identity.md) we run our OWN
// Better Auth (1.6.x), mounted in-process in each app by @quagga/auth against our
// own Neon database — NOT managed Neon Auth. Self-hosting removes the managed
// provider's fixed-subset limitation: every core email/password + session +
// account capability is now a real server call on `auth.api.*`, and change-email
// / unlink (which managed Neon omitted from its server allowlist) are ours.
//
// TWO-FACTOR AND PASSKEYS NOW SHIP. As of migration 0015 both Better Auth plugins
// (twoFactor — TOTP + encrypted backup codes; @better-auth/passkey — WebAuthn,
// rpID scoped to the apex) are wired into @quagga/auth, with their tables owned by
// @quagga/db. So `twoFactor`, `backupCodes` and `passkeys` are `supported` here —
// the account-security surface renders the REAL enrolment/management flows instead
// of the honest "not available yet" cards it showed while the plugins were
// pending. Neither factor is ever the ONLY way in (password/Google stays primary),
// so a lost authenticator or passkey is never a dead end — recovery is a password
// or a 2FA backup code.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: never fake an unsupported capability. A
// surface for an `unavailable` capability must render an honest "not available
// yet" state and its action must fail closed — never a silent no-op that looks
// like success. `assertCapability` is the fail-closed helper.
