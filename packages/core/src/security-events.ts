// Security events — display mapping for the account "recent security events" feed
// (docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §"Security events log").
//
// PURITY CONTRACT (as with the rest of @quagga/core): no I/O, no env, no DB. The
// `security_events` table stores only the typed `kind` (plus request context);
// the human-readable title lives HERE so the DB carries no display strings and a
// wording change never needs a migration. The app composes any device/IP detail
// line itself (it owns the user-agent parser) — this module owns the title only.
