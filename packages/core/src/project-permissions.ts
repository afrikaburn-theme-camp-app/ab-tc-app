// Project permissions (docs/technical-spec/05-camp-roles-and-officers.md §"Roles v2 — permissions, color,
// emoji"). Custom-role permissions are GRANTS ON TOP for plain members; the
// structural `lead`/`admin` roles are the permission BACKSTOP — they implicitly
// hold every project permission and this can never be revoked, so no permission
// edit can ever strand a camp (no self-lockout class of bugs, by construction).
//
// Pure logic only — no I/O. The caller loads a member's structural role plus the
// permissions objects of every project role they hold (INCLUDING the derived
// baseline role, which everyone holds) and passes them in.
