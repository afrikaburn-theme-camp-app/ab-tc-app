    //
    // Measured on run 30939995495 (4 Aug 2026): phone-input's typing case timed
    // out at the 5,000 ms default in the `ci` job — while the SAME suite passed
    // in its own `coverage · @quagga/ui` shard in the same push. That asymmetry
    // is the whole diagnosis: the coverage matrix gives each workspace a runner
    // to itself, and `ci` runs `turbo run test` across all eight at once. Under
    // that contention a case that renders a React tree ten times (one
    // fireEvent.change per typed character, through react-phone-number-input)
    // legitimately crosses five seconds.
    //
    // For scale: this suite spends 28 s in tests and 43 s in environment setup
    // locally, and 81 s / 102 s on the runner. A limit inside that noise fails
    // at random, and a gate that fails at random is a gate people learn to
    // re-run rather than read.
