// The honest "we can't do this yet" block, shared by all three apps.

// THE RULE (docs/technical-spec/02-accounts-and-account-security.md §"Capability matrix"): a
// surface for a capability our auth server does not expose must say so plainly
// and offer NO control that pretends otherwise.
//
// THE AUTHORITY IS @quagga/core's `AUTH_CAPABILITIES`, and it stays there. This
// component takes the ALREADY-RESOLVED verdict as data because @quagga/ui
// depends on @quagga/types and nothing else — importing core's runtime here
// would drag business logic into the presentation package for the sake of one
// lookup. Each app resolves the capability and passes what it found, so the day
// a capability flips to `supported` the notice still disappears everywhere at
// once.
//
// Deliberately not styled as an error: nothing is broken, and nothing the reader
// did caused it.
